# Good Strategy Bad Strategy

Most strategy is bad strategy. Not because strategists are dumb—because real strategy requires choices, and choices create conflict. Organizations optimize for avoiding conflict. The result: "strategies" that are actually negotiated lists, financial targets, or vision statements with no teeth.

## The smell test

You can detect bad strategy in five minutes:

**No diagnosis.** The document jumps to goals and initiatives. Ask: "What's the hard problem this solves?" If they can't name it crisply—not symptoms, the actual obstacle—there's no strategy.

**It's a list.** Each stakeholder got their priority included. Nothing was cut. That's not strategy. That's appeasement.

**Blue-sky language.** "Leverage synergies." "Customer-centric innovation." "Best-in-class execution." Translation: we haven't decided anything. Ask them to say it in plain English and watch them flounder.

**Goals without a how.** "Our strategy is 15% CAGR." No. That's a target. Strategy is how—what specific insight lets you achieve it when competitors want the same thing?

**No hard choices visible.** If the strategy doesn't say what you *won't* do, it's not strategy. "We'll do everything, just better" is wishful thinking.

## Why bad strategy happens

Organizations produce bad strategy reliably because:

**Strategy requires saying no.** Focus on X means not-Y. Not-Y has a champion with power. Saying no creates enemies. So organizations say yes to everything and call it strategy.

**Diagnosis requires honesty that gets punished.** Real problems implicate people. The CEO's pet project. The acquisition that failed. The legacy business everyone's sentimental about. Naming the problem means naming names.

**Strategy bets on an unproven thesis.** If it fails, someone's responsible. Vague goals and long lists keep everyone safe. You can't be wrong about "pursue excellence."

When you see bad strategy, ask: *what conflict was this designed to avoid?*

## The kernel

Good strategy has three parts. Only three.

**1. Diagnosis**

What's actually going on? Not the symptoms—the underlying dynamic.

Not "sales are down." *Why* are sales down? "Our cost structure makes us uncompetitive in mid-market, and premium is shrinking."

The diagnosis should make people uncomfortable. If everyone nods easily, you've named the problem everyone's willing to acknowledge—not the real one.

The test: Does it identify the 1-2 things that, if solved, change everything?

**2. Guiding Policy**

An approach that addresses the diagnosis. Not a goal—a *method*.

"Focus on enterprise customers" is a guiding policy. "Be number one" is not.

Good guiding policy creates clarity by ruling things out. New opportunity arises—the policy tells you yes or no.

The test: Does it help you make decisions?

**3. Coherent Action**

Specific steps that implement the policy. *Coherent* means they reinforce each other.

If sales is pushing volume while product builds premium features, you don't have strategy. You have political compromise.

The test: Would someone looking only at the actions infer the guiding policy?

## Diagnosis: the hard part

Most strategy fails here. They describe symptoms or jump to solutions.

**Name the obstacle.** What specifically blocks progress? Not "competition"—what about competition? Their cost structure? Their distribution? Their lock-in?

**Find the asymmetry.** What's true for you that isn't true for others? What can you do that they can't? What do you see that they don't?

**Identify the crux.** Of all challenges, which matters most? Which one, solved, unlocks the others? Strategy is focus.

**Challenge the conventional view.** Your whole industry shares assumptions about what's happening. One of them is probably wrong in an exploitable way.

## Leverage

Strategy finds the points where focused effort creates disproportionate results.

**Pivotal moments.** Transitions, competitor stumbles, regulatory shifts. Asymmetries peak when things change.

**Chain-link systems.** One weak link constrains everything. Fix it and the system transforms. Invest everywhere else and nothing moves.

**Competitor blind spots.** What can't they do? Won't they do? Are too successful to bother with?

**Your unfair advantage.** What's easy for you and hard for them?

Spread effort thin and nothing breaks through. Concentrate on leverage points.

## Proximate objectives

The best objectives are close enough to be feasible and clear enough to guide action.

"Put a man on the moon by decade's end" works—ambitious but specific, with an imaginable path.

"Advance human potential" fails—too abstract to plan against.

**The test:** Can you see the first moves? Not the whole path—but enough to start? If the objective is so distant you can't imagine step one, it's not proximate enough.

When overwhelmed, the strategic move is finding the proximate objective—the achievable next step that positions you for the one after.

## Focus as strategy

Good strategy looks incomplete. It ignores most issues to concentrate on the few that matter.

This makes people nervous. "What about X?" "Don't forget Y."

The discipline: if X is critical, it's in the kernel. If X just seems important, it waits. If adding X dilutes focus, X is cut.

Every priority divides attention. Five priorities means none.

The strategy with the tightest focus usually wins—not because focus is magic, but because focus is rare. Most competitors are spreading themselves thin trying to cover everything. Concentrated force beats dispersed force.

## Evaluating strategy

Five questions:

1. **What's the diagnosis?** What specific challenge does this address? *(Can't answer crisply = bad strategy)*

2. **What's the guiding policy?** What's the approach? What does this rule out? *(Nothing ruled out = bad strategy)*

3. **Are actions coherent?** Do they reinforce each other? *(Pulling different directions = bad strategy)*

4. **Where's the leverage?** What asymmetry is being exploited? *(No asymmetry = just effort, not strategy)*

5. **What hard choice was made?** What did you decide not to do? *(Everything still on the table = bad strategy)*

A strategy that survives these questions might still fail. But at least it's a strategy.

## The real move

When someone hands you a strategy document, don't start with what's in it. Start with what's missing.

Where's the diagnosis? (Probably absent or shallow.)

What's not being said? (Probably the actual problem.)

What conflict did this avoid? (That's where the real strategic question lives.)

Bad strategy is the default. The document that acknowledges no hard choices, names no obstacles, rules out no options—that's what organizations produce when left alone.

Good strategy is rare because it requires what organizations resist: honest diagnosis, genuine focus, and the willingness to be wrong about something specific.
