# 7 Powers

The framework for asking: does this business have a defensible position, or is it a commodity with good marketing?

## Power is benefit plus barrier

Most strategy frameworks focus on differentiation—being better. That's not power.

Power requires two things:
1. **Benefit**: Something that improves your economics (lower costs, higher prices, better retention)
2. **Barrier**: Something that prevents competitors from copying that benefit

The barrier is where most claimed "power" falls apart. Everyone has benefits. Few have barriers that hold.

When assessing strategy, ask: **What's the barrier?** If the answer is vague ("we move fast," "we have great culture," "we know the market"), there is no power. The benefit will get competed away.

## The diagnostic

### Scale Economies

**The benefit**: Per-unit costs decline as volume increases.

**What actually creates the barrier**: Fixed costs spread over more units. But the question is magnitude. Every business has some scale economies. Power exists only when the cost curve is steep enough that a challenger, starting smaller, faces structurally worse unit economics for years—long enough that they run out of capital or can't match your pricing.

**Red flags (claimed scale economies that aren't power)**:
- "We'll have lower costs at scale" — everyone will. What makes your curve steeper?
- Scale economies in commodity inputs — your supplier's scale economies, not yours
- Scale in a segment, not the business — local advantage that doesn't compound

**Probe**: At what scale do costs plateau? How long would it take a well-funded competitor to reach the same cost structure? If the answer is "2-3 years with enough capital," this isn't power.

---

### Network Effects

**The benefit**: Value to each user increases as more users join.

**What actually creates the barrier**: Critical mass. Once you're past the tipping point, challengers can't attract users because your network is more valuable, and they can't become more valuable without users. The loop locks.

**Red flags (claimed network effects that aren't power)**:
- "Users share content" — that's virality, not network effects. Sharing helps acquisition; it doesn't increase value to existing users.
- "Marketplace" without critical density — many markets need local or category saturation to tip. National GMV means nothing if you're thin everywhere.
- "Social features" — users can post and comment. So what? The question is whether your network's value is proportional to its size.

**Probe**: What specifically becomes more valuable as the network grows? At what scale does it tip? Is the network effect same-side (more users = more value to users) or cross-side (more supply = more value to demand)? Cross-side is more common, weaker, and often doesn't create lock-in.

---

### Counter-Positioning

**The benefit**: A new business model that produces superior economics for the challenger.

**What actually creates the barrier**: The incumbent *cannot adopt the new model without damaging their existing business*. Not "won't"—can't.

This is the most misunderstood power. Differentiation is not counter-positioning. Doing something better is not counter-positioning. Counter-positioning exists only when responding to you would require the incumbent to cannibalize their core revenue, antagonize their existing customers, or abandon their distribution model.

**Red flags (claimed counter-positioning that isn't power)**:
- "We're disrupting X" — buzzword, not analysis. What specifically prevents X from doing what you do?
- "They're slow / they don't get it" — that's an execution gap, not a structural barrier. They can hire and learn.
- "They'd have to change their culture" — cultures change when revenue is threatened. This is not a barrier.

**Probe**: If the incumbent's board convened tomorrow and decided to copy you exactly, what would stop them? If the answer involves their existing revenue, distribution, or customer expectations—there may be power. If the answer is "they'd have to be smart enough to try"—there's no power.

**The canonical test**: Does responding to you require them to destroy something they have? Verizon can't match Google Fi's pricing without destroying ARPU. Enterprise software companies can't unbundle without destroying their sales model. That's counter-positioning. Everything else is just competition.

### Switching Costs

**The benefit**: Customers stay even when competitors offer better alternatives, because leaving is costly.

**What actually creates the barrier**: The cost of switching—financial, procedural, emotional—exceeds the benefit of the competing offer.

**Red flags (claimed switching costs that aren't power)**:
- "Our customers love us" — that's satisfaction, not lock-in. Love doesn't survive a 30% discount.
- "We integrate deeply" — so will your competitor. Integration is a one-time cost; switching costs must be recurring.
- "Data lives in our platform" — exportable? Then it's not lock-in.

**Probe**: If a competitor offered the same thing at 20% lower price, how many customers would stay? If a customer left after 3 years, how much would they lose that they couldn't rebuild elsewhere?

**The real switching costs**: Financial (liquidating a position, breaking a contract, repricing derivatives). Procedural (retraining staff, rebuilding workflows, re-integrating systems). Emotional (identity, relationships with account teams, community ties).

---

### Branding

**The benefit**: Customers pay a premium or choose preferentially based on associations beyond functional attributes.

**What actually creates the barrier**: Decades of consistent delivery that creates trust, identity, or aspiration that competitors can't replicate quickly.

**For early-stage companies: Ignore this power.** You don't have it. You can't build it in years. It requires generational consistency. Startups that claim branding power are confused about what branding is.

**The test for whether branding is real power**: Would customers pay 20%+ more for functionally identical products? If not, you have awareness, not power.

---

### Cornered Resource

**The benefit**: Preferential access to a valuable asset—talent, patents, regulatory licenses, content, location.

**What actually creates the barrier**: The resource is genuinely scarce and cannot be replicated or substituted.

**Red flags (claimed cornered resources that aren't power)**:
- "Our team is exceptional" — teams are liquid. Cornered resource means you have locked-in access that competitors cannot match through recruitment or acquisition.
- "Patents" — most patents are narrow, designable-around, or not worth enforcing. A patent thicket might be power; a handful of patents rarely is.
- "First-mover data advantage" — data compounds slowly and commoditizes quickly. Unless your data is structurally unreplicable (not just hard to replicate), this isn't power.

**Probe**: Can this resource be bought? Hired away? Built? Licensed? Substituted with something nearly as good? If yes to any, it's not cornered.

---

### Process Power

**The benefit**: Embedded organizational capabilities that produce lower costs or higher quality than competitors.

**What actually creates the barrier**: Organizational complexity built over years that cannot be copied because it exists tacitly in systems, culture, and coordination—not in documentable processes.

**For early-stage companies: Ignore this power.** Like branding, it requires decades. Toyota's production system is process power. Your startup's "velocity" is not.

---

## When power can be established

This is Helmer's dynamics contribution. Different powers are achievable at different stages:

**At origination (pre-product-market fit)**:
- Counter-positioning — baked into the model from day one, or never
- Cornered resource — you have it or you don't

**At takeoff (scaling)**:
- Network effects — must be triggered during growth; retrofitting is nearly impossible
- Scale economies — build during expansion; the curve steepens as you grow
- Switching costs — built as customers adopt and integrate; each cohort locks in

**At stability (market leader)**:
- Branding — decades of consistent delivery
- Process Power — decades of refinement

The implication: if you're scaling without building power, you're building a commodity business. Growth without power accumulation is vanity.

## The "so what?" question

Power is potential energy. You must convert it to economics.

**If you have network effects**: Are you pricing to capture value, or racing to subsidize growth indefinitely?

**If you have switching costs**: Are you actually charging a premium, or are you afraid to "risk the relationship"?

**If you have scale economies**: Have you passed the cost savings to customers (competing them away) or captured them as margin?

Power creates the *potential* for differential returns. Execution determines whether you capture them.

---

## The final question

When assessing any business, ask:

1. What power does this business claim to have?
2. What is the *specific mechanism* of the barrier? (Not the benefit—the barrier.)
3. Is the barrier sufficient? At what point would a well-funded, competent competitor overcome it?
4. If power exists, is it being captured as margin, or competed away?

Most businesses have no power. They have differentiation, execution advantages, temporary leads. Those are real—but they're not defensible.

Power is rare. That's why persistent differential returns are rare.
