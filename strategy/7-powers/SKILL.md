# 7 Powers

Power is the only source of durable competitive advantage. There are exactly seven types. Most businesses have zero. If you can't name yours, you probably don't have one.

---

## When to Use This

**Evaluating a business or strategy:**
- Due diligence on a company, investment, or acquisition
- "What's our moat?" came up in a strategy discussion
- Someone claimed competitive advantage—you want to test it

**Pressure-testing your own position:**
- You're growing fast and wondering if you're building something defensible
- Competitors are emerging and you're unsure if you can hold them off
- You're about to raise and need to articulate your defensibility

**Planning for power:**
- You're pre-PMF and choosing what model to pursue
- You're scaling and need to decide what power to build
- You're prioritizing between features that might create lock-in vs. features that just make the product better

**The uncomfortable trigger:** You're succeeding, but you can't articulate why a well-funded competitor couldn't replicate it in 2-3 years.

## The Core Insight

Most strategy frameworks focus on being better. That's not power. Being better is a temporary state. Someone can always outwork you.

Power requires two things:
1. **Benefit**: Something that improves your economics—lower costs, higher prices, better retention
2. **Barrier**: Something that prevents competitors from copying that benefit

The barrier is where most claimed power falls apart. Everyone has benefits. Few have barriers that hold. The awkward truth: your "competitive advantage" is probably just execution that a well-funded competitor could replicate in two years.

**The test:** If your board decided tomorrow to copy a competitor exactly, what would stop them? If you have a clear answer involving structural constraints, there may be power. If the answer involves execution, culture, or "they'd have to be smart enough to try"—there's no power.

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Diagnose mode** — "What power does this business actually have?"
- **Build mode** — "What power can we establish, given our stage?"
- **Capture mode** — "We have power—are we converting it to margin?"

---

## Diagnose Mode: The Honest Assessment

You're evaluating a business—yours or someone else's. The goal is truth, not comfort.

### The opening question

**What power does this business claim?**

Listen for: scale economies, network effects, switching costs, branding, counter-positioning, cornered resource, process power. If they don't use these terms, translate what they're describing.

Then: **What's the specific mechanism of the barrier?**

Not the benefit—the barrier. "We have lower costs" is a benefit. "Our cost curve requires $2B in infrastructure investment to match" is a barrier mechanism.

### The seven-power diagnostic

For each claimed power, apply the specific test:

**Scale Economies**
- At what scale do costs plateau?
- How long would it take a well-funded competitor to reach the same cost structure?
- If the answer is "2-3 years with enough capital"—this isn't power.

**Network Effects**
- What specifically becomes more valuable as the network grows?
- At what scale does it tip?
- Is the network effect same-side or cross-side? (Cross-side is weaker and often doesn't create lock-in.)

**Counter-Positioning**
- If the incumbent decided to copy you exactly, what would stop them?
- Does responding require them to destroy something they have—revenue, distribution, customer relationships?
- If the barrier is that "they'd have to change their culture"—cultures change when revenue is threatened. Not power.

**Switching Costs**
- If a competitor offered 20% lower price, how many customers would stay?
- What do customers lose that they can't rebuild elsewhere?
- Are switching costs financial, procedural, or emotional? (All three together is strongest.)

**Branding**
- Would customers pay 20%+ more for functionally identical products?
- If not, you have awareness, not power.
- For early-stage: skip this. You don't have it and can't build it in years.

**Cornered Resource**
- Can this resource be bought, hired away, built, licensed, or substituted?
- If yes to any—it's not cornered.
- "Our team is exceptional" is not a cornered resource. Teams are liquid.

**Process Power**
- Is this documented knowledge or tacit organizational capability?
- Has it been built over decades?
- For early-stage: skip this. Your "velocity" is not process power.

### Red flag phrases

When you hear these, dig deeper—they usually mask an absence of power:

| They say | What's probably true |
|----------|---------------------|
| "We move faster" | Execution gap, not structural barrier |
| "We know the market better" | Knowledge can be acquired |
| "Our culture is special" | Cultures change when revenue is threatened |
| "We have the data advantage" | Data commoditizes faster than you think |
| "We're the leader" | Leadership isn't power—it's temporary position |
| "We're disrupting X" | Buzzword, not analysis |

### Output format

1. **Claimed power**: What power does the business believe it has?
2. **Barrier mechanism**: What specifically prevents competitors from replicating the benefit?
3. **Barrier durability**: How long would it take a well-funded, competent competitor to overcome it?
4. **Verdict**: Real power, emerging power, or no power?

Be direct. Most businesses have no power. That's the honest assessment.

## Build Mode: Establishing Power

You're at a stage where power can be established. Different powers are available at different moments.

### Stage-based options

**At origination (pre-PMF):**
- **Counter-positioning** — baked into the model from day one, or never. Ask: Does our model require incumbents to cannibalize themselves to respond?
- **Cornered resource** — you have it or you don't. Ask: Do we have access to something scarce that can't be replicated?

**At takeoff (scaling):**
- **Network effects** — must be triggered during growth. Ask: What in our product becomes more valuable as more people use it? How do we reach critical mass?
- **Scale economies** — build during expansion. Ask: What fixed costs can we spread? How steep is our cost curve?
- **Switching costs** — built as customers adopt. Ask: What creates procedural, financial, or emotional lock-in as customers go deeper?

**At stability (market leader):**
- **Branding** and **Process Power** — require decades. Not relevant for early stages.

### The honest questions

Before planning power-building:

1. **What stage are we actually in?** (Not where we wish we were.)
2. **Which powers are available at this stage?**
3. **Are we building toward power, or just growing?**

The uncomfortable truth: if you're scaling without accumulating power, you're building a commodity business. Growth without power is vanity.

### Designing for power

For each power you want to build:

- **What's the specific mechanism?** Not "we'll have network effects" but "each new seller increases selection, which increases buyer conversion, which attracts more sellers."
- **What's the trigger?** When does the power lock in? What's the tipping point?
- **What's the timeline?** How long until the barrier is durable?
- **What could go wrong?** How might the power fail to materialize?

### Output format

1. **Stage**: Where is this business in its lifecycle?
2. **Available powers**: Which can realistically be established now?
3. **Power strategy**: What specific mechanism are you building toward?
4. **Trigger conditions**: What needs to happen for the power to lock in?
5. **Risk**: What could prevent the power from materializing?

## Capture Mode: Converting Power to Margin

You have power. The question is whether you're converting it to differential returns.

### The gap between potential and capture

Power creates *potential* for superior economics. Execution determines whether you capture it.

**Network effects:** Are you pricing to capture value, or racing to subsidize growth indefinitely?

**Switching costs:** Are you actually charging a premium, or are you afraid to "risk the relationship"?

**Scale economies:** Have you passed the savings to customers (competing them away) or captured them as margin?

**Counter-positioning:** Are you exploiting the incumbent's constraints, or playing it safe?

### The audit

For each source of power:

1. **How are you monetizing it?** Be specific about price, margin, or retention advantage.
2. **Are you leaving money on the table?** What would happen if you charged more?
3. **Are you competing it away?** Passing benefits to customers that you could capture?
4. **What's the evidence?** Gross margin, retention rates, price premium vs. competitors?

### Output format

1. **Power identified**: What power exists?
2. **Current capture**: How is it being converted to economics?
3. **Capture gap**: Where is value being left on the table?
4. **Recommendation**: How to better convert power to margin?

## The Hard Truth

Power is rare. That's why persistent differential returns are rare.

Most businesses have differentiation, execution advantages, temporary leads. Those are real—but they're not defensible. The competitor with enough capital and patience can replicate them.

When you analyze a business, including your own, the question isn't "is this a good business?" The question is: **Can this position be defended?**

If you can't name the barrier—the specific mechanism that prevents a well-funded competitor from replicating your benefit in 2-3 years—then you don't have power.

You might still have a good business. You might make money. But you're in a race, not a fortress. And races exhaust you. One stumble and you're passed.

Helmer's framework isn't pessimistic. It's honest. Most founders tell themselves stories about moats they don't have. Then they're surprised when the moat doesn't hold.

Know what you have. Know what you're building. Don't confuse benefits with barriers. That's the only way to build something durable.
