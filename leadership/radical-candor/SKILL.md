description: Kim Scott's discipline for feedback that's kind because it's clear. Activate before a hard conversation you're avoiding, after one that didn't land, or when you realize you've been "nice" instead of honest. The more you want to soften the message, the more you need this.

# Radical Candor

## When to Use This

**Before a conversation you're dreading:**
- You need to give critical feedback and keep rehearsing softer versions
- Someone's underperforming and you've been hinting instead of saying
- You're about to have a difficult 1:1 and want to get it right
- You've written feedback and it sounds harsh—or toothless

**After a conversation that felt off:**
- You said the thing but they got defensive
- You chickened out and said a diluted version
- It felt productive but nothing's changing
- You're not sure if you were caring or cowardly

**When building feedback culture:**
- You want your team to tell you the truth
- Someone gives you feedback and you feel yourself getting defensive
- You're wondering why people don't speak up

**The rule:** If you're softening the message to protect yourself from discomfort, you need this skill.

## The Core Problem

You're not failing by being too harsh. You're failing by being too nice.

You see someone struggling, making mistakes, heading toward failure. Because you care, you soften the message. You hint instead of stating. You sandwich criticism in so much padding it disappears.

That's not kind. That's cowardice dressed as kindness.

Scott calls it Ruinous Empathy. What it feels like: watching someone underperform for months, giving gentle suggestions, then suddenly they're on a PIP—blindsided, because nobody ever told them the truth.

The math is simple: short-term discomfort for you, or long-term damage for them. You keep choosing your comfort.

## The Framework

Two dimensions. Both required.

**Care Personally:** You know their context. You're thinking about their career, not just this quarter. You've earned the right to challenge them because they know you're on their side.

**Challenge Directly:** You say the actual thing. Not a hint. Not a softer version. The thing they need to hear, clearly enough that they can act on it.

Most people do one or the other:
- **Ruinous Empathy** (care without challenge): "I don't want to hurt their feelings" → They never improve
- **Obnoxious Aggression** (challenge without care): "I'm just being honest" → They can't hear you
- **Manipulative Insincerity** (neither): Passive-aggressive, political, toxic

Radical Candor is both. It's hard every time.

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Prepare mode** — "I need to have a hard conversation. Help me get it right."
- **Debrief mode** — "I just had a conversation. Help me see where I landed."
- **Culture mode** — "I want to build a team that tells each other the truth."

---

## Prepare Mode: Before the Conversation

You're about to say something difficult. Let's make sure it lands.

### The scaffolding questions

**1. What's the specific behavior?**

Not "you're unclear." That's a judgment about the person. What did they actually do? "The report had three different conclusions and the stakeholders left confused." Behavior, not character.

**2. What's the impact?**

Why does it matter? Not to pile on—to help them understand stakes. "We lost the budget approval and now we're a month behind." Impact makes feedback real.

**3. What do you want them to do differently?**

Vague feedback creates vague anxiety. "Be more strategic" is useless. "In roadmap reviews, connect each feature to a business goal" is actionable. If you can't name what you want, you're not ready.

**4. What's your state?**

If you're frustrated, angry, or rehearsing how right you are—wait. You'll contaminate the message. The conversation isn't for your relief; it's for their benefit.

**5. Have you earned the right?**

Care isn't something you bolt on in the moment. If you haven't invested in this relationship, your feedback will land as attack no matter how you phrase it. What have you done to show you're on their side?

### The conversation itself

Start with the behavior, not the person. State the impact. Say what you want. Then stop.

Don't keep talking to fill the silence. Let them respond.

If they get defensive: don't escalate, don't back down. Acknowledge the feeling ("I can see this is hard to hear") and hold the observation ("And I still think the presentation didn't land").

If they argue: listen. You might be wrong. If you're not, you'll find a better way to say it.

### Common traps to avoid

**The compliment sandwich.** Criticism between two slices of praise. Everyone knows this trick. It makes praise meaningless and criticism invisible. Just say the thing.

**"Just being honest."** If you hear yourself saying this, you're in Obnoxious Aggression. Honesty without care is cruelty with better branding.

**Waiting for the right moment.** If you've been waiting for weeks, the issue is your avoidance, not the timing.

---

## Debrief Mode: After the Conversation

You had the conversation. Let's figure out where you actually landed.

### The diagnostic

**1. Did you say the thing?**

The actual thing. Not a hint. Not a softer version. Not wrapped in so much context they missed it.

If you're not sure they heard it, they didn't. If you're hoping they'll figure it out, they won't.

**2. Could they hear you?**

Did they get defensive? Shut down? Miss the point entirely?

If so: Was the relationship strong enough to carry this? Did you state it as behavior or as character? Were you frustrated, and did it leak through?

**3. Where did you land on the quadrant?**

Be honest:

| | Challenged Directly | Didn't Challenge |
|---|---|---|
| **Cared Personally** | Radical Candor | Ruinous Empathy |
| **Didn't Care** | Obnoxious Aggression | Manipulative Insincerity |

Most people, most of the time, land in Ruinous Empathy. You're probably not the exception.

**4. What happens now?**

The conversation isn't the end. It's the beginning.

- Are you going to notice whether the behavior shifts?
- Will you acknowledge it when it does?
- Will you have the conversation again if it doesn't?

If you're not prepared to follow through, you had the conversation for your own relief, not their benefit.

### If it went badly

**They got defensive:** The message might have been right, but something blocked it. Usually one of:
- The relationship wasn't strong enough (they didn't trust your intentions)
- You stated it as character, not behavior ("you're unclear" vs. "the report was unclear")
- Your frustration leaked through despite your words

Next time: more investment in the relationship, or cleaner delivery, or cooling down first.

**You chickened out:** You said a softer version. You hinted. You left room for them to miss it.

Notice what you were protecting: their feelings, or your comfort? Be honest. Then decide if you're going to try again.

## Culture Mode: Building a Feedback Team

You can't demand a feedback culture. You build it by modeling.

### Start by asking

Ask for feedback first—and mean it. "What could I have done better in that meeting?"

Then: don't defend. Don't explain. Don't argue. Thank them and act on it.

The first time you punish someone for honest feedback—even subtly, even by getting defensive—you've killed the culture.

### The questions to ask yourself

**Am I actually open to this?**

If you ask for feedback and feel yourself getting defensive, notice it. Say it out loud: "I'm noticing I want to defend myself. Let me just listen."

**Do people see me act on feedback?**

Asking is step one. Acting is what matters. If they never see change, they'll stop telling you the truth.

**When was the last time I admitted I was wrong?**

Publicly. To the team. About something that mattered. If you can't remember, you're probably not modeling what you think you are.

### Making praise land

Praise evaporates. Criticism sticks. To counter this asymmetry:

- **Be specific.** "Great job" disappears. "Your decision to cut the secondary features kept us on schedule—that was the right call and not obvious" sticks.
- **Mean it.** People smell performative praise. If you're praising to soften upcoming criticism, skip it.
- **Praise the struggle.** Anyone can notice success. Notice what was hard about getting there.

## Quick Reference

### Before the conversation

- [ ] Specific behavior (not character)
- [ ] Clear impact (why it matters)
- [ ] Actionable request (what you want)
- [ ] Your state is clean (not frustrated or righteous)
- [ ] Relationship is strong enough to carry this

### Signals you're in Ruinous Empathy

- You keep rehearsing softer versions
- You're hoping they'll "figure it out"
- You said it but left room for them to miss it
- It's been weeks and you're still "waiting for the right moment"
- They were surprised by the PIP/review/consequence

### Signals you're in Obnoxious Aggression

- You're frustrated and it's leaking through
- You're more focused on being right than on helping
- "I'm just being honest" is in your head
- They got defensive and you escalated
- You stated it as character, not behavior

### The follow-through check

- Will you notice if the behavior changes?
- Will you acknowledge the change?
- Will you have the conversation again if it doesn't?
- Are you doing this for their benefit or your relief?

## The Point

Feedback is how people grow. When you withhold it, you're not being kind—you're being negligent. When you deliver it poorly, you're not being honest—you're being lazy.

Being nice isn't being kind. The kind thing is the clear thing. Care enough to be uncomfortable. Know them well enough that they can hear you. Then say the true thing, clearly, without cruelty.

That's Radical Candor. It's hard every single time. Do it anyway.
