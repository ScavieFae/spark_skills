# The First 90 Days

You just started a new role. Congratulations. You're now in the most dangerous period of your career.

Not because you're incompetent—you got this job for a reason. But because what made you successful before probably won't work here. You're operating on instinct in an environment where your instincts are miscalibrated.

Watkins studied leaders in transition and found a pattern: most failures happen not from lack of skill but from failure to adapt. They keep running the old playbook in a new context. They act before they understand. They try to prove themselves instead of learning the terrain.

The first 90 days set patterns that persist for years. Get them wrong, and you'll spend the rest of your tenure fighting problems you created in your first months.

## When to Use This

- You just started a new role and feel underwater
- You're preparing for a transition and want to plan it
- Someone new is drowning and you can't figure out why

**The stakes:** Transitions are when careers derail. The window is short, the patterns you set now calcify fast.

---

## The Core Problem

You're underwater.

Before you can contribute, you have to learn. But you feel pressure to act—to prove you deserve this job, to show momentum, to look decisive. So you act before you understand. You apply solutions from your last job. You make promises based on incomplete information.

Watkins calls this the breakeven point: the moment when you start contributing more value than you're consuming. Until then, you're a net drain on the organization. You're using other people's time, depleting political capital, making decisions with bad data.

The goal isn't to act fast. It's to reach breakeven fast. Those are different things.

Most new leaders fail not because they're bad at their jobs but because they're solving the wrong problems, building the wrong relationships, or fighting battles they didn't know they'd started.

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Assess mode** — "I'm in a new role. Help me understand my situation."
- **Plan mode** — "I need to build my 90-day plan."
- **Diagnose mode** — "Something's wrong. I'm three months in and drowning."

## Assess Mode: What Situation Are You Actually In?

Before you do anything else, understand what kind of transition you're facing.

### The STARS model

Not all transitions are the same. Watkins identifies five situations, each requiring a different approach:

**Startup:** Building something from nothing. No playbook, no team, maybe no customers. You need to move fast, tolerate ambiguity, build while flying.

**Turnaround:** Something's broken and everyone knows it. There's urgency, often crisis. You have permission to make big changes fast, but the clock is ticking.

**Accelerated Growth:** It's working—now scale it. The systems that got you here won't get you there. You need to build infrastructure without killing the thing that's winning.

**Realignment:** It's drifting, but no one sees the danger. This is the hardest—you have to convince people there's a problem before you can fix it. Less permission, more persuasion.

**Sustaining Success:** You inherited something good. Don't screw it up. The risk is complacency or unnecessary change. Your job is to maintain and gradually improve.

**The trap:** Treating every situation like a turnaround. Coming in hot, making sweeping changes, demanding urgency—when the situation calls for patience and learning.

### The questions to answer

**What's the business situation?** STARS. Be honest about which one you're in.

**What does your boss actually want?** Not what they said in the interview. What are they measured on? What would make them look good?

**What's the culture?** How do decisions get made here? Who has influence? What behaviors get rewarded or punished?

**What's broken, and what's working?** Most new leaders focus on problems. Find out what's working first—you might accidentally kill it.

**What don't you know?** Make a list. It should be long. If it's short, you're overconfident.

### Who to talk to

In your first weeks, your job is learning. Talk to:

- Your boss (what does success look like?)
- Your peers (what should I know that no one will tell me?)
- Your team (what's working? what's frustrating?)
- Key stakeholders (what do they need from your function?)
- People who've been here a while (what's the real history?)

Ask the same questions to multiple people. Where stories diverge is where the interesting stuff is.

## Plan Mode: The 90-Day Structure

You've assessed. Now plan.

### The three phases

**Days 1-30: Learn.** Resist the urge to act. Your job is to understand the terrain, build relationships, and identify the real problems (not the presenting symptoms).

**Days 31-60: Design.** You know enough now to start shaping strategy. What are the priorities? What early wins can you secure? What changes need to happen?

**Days 61-90: Execute and refine.** Implement the changes you've designed. Secure your early wins. Adjust based on what you've learned.

### Early wins

You need wins in the first 90 days. Not because you need ego validation—because you need credibility. Credibility buys you room to make bigger changes later.

Good early wins:
- Visible, meaningful to stakeholders
- Quick enough to achieve in 60-90 days
- Aligned with your boss's priorities
- Build momentum without overcommitting

Bad early wins:
- Impressive to you but invisible to others
- Require resources you don't have yet
- Create enemies before you have allies
- Set expectations you can't sustain

**Watkins' warning:** Don't try to do too much. Pick 2-3 things that matter. Doing fewer things well beats doing many things badly.

### The 90-day plan template

Your plan should answer:

1. **What will I learn in the first 30 days?** (conversations, research, observation)
2. **What are the 2-3 early wins I'll pursue?** (specific, achievable, visible)
3. **What relationships do I need to build?** (boss, peers, team, stakeholders)
4. **What do I need to stop doing?** (habits from the old role that don't serve here)
5. **What does success look like at day 90?** (concrete, measurable)

### Your team

You will likely need to make changes to your team. Watkins' framework:

**Keep:** Right skills, right attitude, performing well. Invest in these people.

**Develop:** Right attitude, skills gap. Worth the investment if you have time.

**Move:** Wrong role, might be right elsewhere. Help them find the right seat.

**Exit:** Not working, not going to work. The longer you wait, the worse it gets.

**The trap:** Deciding too fast or too slow. Give yourself 30-60 days to assess, then act. Keeping someone who needs to go poisons the team. Firing someone who needed support poisons your reputation.

## Diagnose Mode: You're Drowning

You're past the first 90 days and something's wrong. Let's figure out what.

### Common failure patterns

**You acted before you understood:**
You came in with answers before you knew the questions. Now you're solving the wrong problems or fighting battles you didn't know you'd started.

*The fix:* Stop. Go back to learning mode. Talk to people you should have talked to earlier. Admit what you don't know.

**You stuck with what you know:**
You're running your old playbook in a new context. The things that made you successful before aren't working here.

*The fix:* Ask yourself: what does this situation actually need? Not what are you good at—what does the situation need?

**You didn't build relationships:**
You've been so focused on the work that you forgot the people. Now you have no allies, no credibility, and no one telling you the truth.

*The fix:* Start building relationships now. It's late but not too late. Find the people you need on your side and invest in those relationships.

**You tried to do too much:**
You're spread thin, nothing's getting done well, and your team is exhausted. You set unrealistic expectations and now you're trapped by them.

*The fix:* Prioritize ruthlessly. What 2-3 things actually matter? Let the rest drop or delegate.

**You created enemies:**
You moved too fast, didn't bring people along, and now you're fighting political battles that are draining your energy.

*The fix:* Figure out who you've alienated and why. Some relationships are recoverable. Some aren't. For the ones that are, apologize and rebuild. For the ones that aren't, work around them.

### The honest questions

- What did I assume that turned out to be wrong?
- What signals did I miss or ignore?
- What relationships should I have built that I didn't?
- What's my boss actually worried about? Have I asked?
- If I were fired tomorrow, what would be the reason?

## Quick Reference

### The STARS situations

| Situation | What it looks like | What it needs |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| Startup | Nothing exists yet | Speed, ambiguity tolerance, building |
| Turnaround | Crisis, everyone knows | Big changes, urgency, decisiveness |
| Accelerated Growth | Working, needs to scale | Systems, infrastructure, not breaking it |
| Realignment | Drifting, no one sees it | Persuasion, patience, creating urgency |
| Sustaining Success | Good, don't screw it up | Maintenance, gradual improvement |

### The 90-day phases

- **Days 1-30:** Learn. Resist action. Build relationships. Understand terrain.
- **Days 31-60:** Design. Set priorities. Plan early wins. Shape strategy.
- **Days 61-90:** Execute. Secure wins. Make changes. Refine approach.

### Questions for your first conversations

- What should I know that no one will tell me?
- What's working that I should be careful not to break?
- What would you do if you were in my role?
- What does success look like to you?
- What's the real history here?

### The breakeven checklist

- [ ] I know what situation I'm in (STARS)
- [ ] I know what my boss actually wants
- [ ] I've built relationships with key stakeholders
- [ ] I've identified 2-3 early wins
- [ ] I know what I don't know
- [ ] I've resisted the urge to act before understanding

## The Voice

Watkins writes like a professor who's studied transitions systematically. He's not warm, but he's precise. The heat comes from the stakes: your career is on the line, the window is short, and most people get this wrong.

The book is a manual for a moment when you're most vulnerable and least equipped. The instincts that got you here—act fast, prove yourself, show decisiveness—are exactly wrong. Transitions require a different discipline: learn first, build relationships, resist the action imperative.

You have 90 days to set patterns that will persist for years. Spend them wisely.
