# High Output Management

Your output = your team's output + the output of teams you influence.

That's it. That's the whole game. You don't ship code. You don't close deals. You create conditions where others do. Stop tracking what you did. Start tracking what you enabled.

Grove ran Intel through hypergrowth, near-death, and the pivot from memory to microprocessors. He applied manufacturing thinking to management. The factory floor has metrics, limiting steps, inspection points. Your calendar should too.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Most managerial activity is low-leverage busywork that feels productive.

You attend meetings where you have no decision rights. You review work without reading it. You "stay in the loop" on things that don't need you. You do IC work because you're faster—never mind that you're not scalable.

Grove would audit your week like a failing production line. Where's the bottleneck? Where's the waste? What are you doing that only you can do?

The modern version is worse. Remote work multiplied meetings. Async tools mean you're cc'd on everything. "Staying aligned" became a full-time job. Most of it is meddling with extra steps.

## When to Use This

**Your week feels wrong:**
- Calendar's full but the team isn't shipping faster
- You're in meetings all day but decisions aren't getting made
- You're exhausted but can't point to what you produced

**You're designing a specific activity:**
- Preparing for a 1:1 that needs to be more than status
- Running a meeting that must end with a decision
- Setting OKRs that will actually drive behavior
- Structuring feedback that will land

**Something's broken:**
- The team's output dropped and you don't know why
- Someone's struggling and you're not sure how to help
- A project's stuck and nobody's unblocking it
- Information isn't flowing and problems surface late

---

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or ask:

- **Audit mode** — "Let's examine where my time/attention is going"
- **Design mode** — "Help me structure this activity for output"
- **Diagnose mode** — "Something's not working. Find the leverage point"

## Audit Mode: The Production Line of Your Week

Your calendar is a production process. Let's audit it.

### The questions

**1. What's your output?**

Not what you did. What the team produced. What decisions got made. What got unblocked. If you can only list your own activities, you're measuring the wrong thing.

**2. How much time is in 1:1s?**

Under 4 hours weekly is underinvestment. This is your early warning system, your training venue, your highest-leverage meeting. Protect it.

**3. How many meetings do you attend without decision rights?**

Each one is leverage lost. "Staying informed" usually means reading the notes would've worked. If you're not deciding or materially influencing, why are you there?

**4. When do you think?**

If never, you're a router. Information passes through you without processing. Block the time or it won't exist.

**5. What did you do this week that only you could do?**

Decisions that needed your authority. Relationships only you hold. Context only you have. Everything else is a delegation opportunity.

### The leverage audit

For each major time investment, ask:

| Activity | Output multiplier? | Could be delegated? | Could be killed? |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Meeting X | ? | ? | ? |
| Project Y | ? | ? | ? |

**High leverage:** Training, 1:1s where you shift someone's thinking, decisions that unblock many people, catching problems early.

**Negative leverage:** Doing the work yourself, meetings without decision rights, meddling in problems your team should own, reviewing without reading.

---

## Design Mode: Architecting for Output

You have a specific activity. Let's design it to produce.

### For 1:1s

Grove: the highest-leverage meeting. Not optional. Not "when there's something to discuss."

**Structure:**

*Their meeting, not yours.* They set the agenda. If they consistently have nothing, you're not asking the right questions or they don't trust you. Both are your problem.

*Key questions:*
- What's blocking you?
- What do you need from me that you're not getting?
- Where did we waste time last week?
- What should I know that I probably don't?

*Listen for "fine."* That's what people say when they don't want to explain. Probe.

*Don't let it become status.* Status is for standups or async. This time is for what needs a human.

*Take notes. Follow up.* Forget what they said and they'll stop telling you things.

### For decision meetings

Must have:
- An owner who drives (name them)
- A decision by the end (or explicit "we lack information to decide")
- Next actions with names attached

**Clarify the mode before you start:**

1. *Free discussion, then I decide.* You own the call. You want input.
2. *Consensus.* Everyone agrees. Slow—use when commitment matters more than speed.
3. *Delegation.* Someone else decides. You're informed.

Say it out loud. Ambiguity about who decides is where meetings die.

**Grove's rule:** More than six people? It's a broadcast. Shrink the room to decide.

### For process meetings (staff, standups)

Regular, predictable, short. For information flow and early problem detection. They're infrastructure—don't skip them, but don't let them bloat.

If it doesn't fit "decision meeting" or "process meeting," question whether it should exist.

### For OKRs

Grove invented these. Simple until you try to use them well.

**Objective:** What you want to achieve. Qualitative, ambitious, time-bound.
**Key Results:** How you'll measure it. Quantitative, specific, verifiable.

*The discipline:*
- 3-5 objectives max; 3-4 KRs per objective max
- Set quarterly, review regularly
- 70% hit rate is success. 100% means you aimed too low.

**Design questions:**
- If we achieve these KRs, will we have actually achieved the objective?
- Can we game the KRs without achieving the real goal?
- Will these drive behavior, or just measure what happens anyway?

### For feedback/reviews

The review should be the least surprising conversation. If they learn they're underperforming in a review, you already failed.

*Structure:*
1. Assess output, not effort. "Worked hard" ≠ "delivered."
2. Be specific. "Communication could improve" is noise. "In three sprint reviews, stakeholders left confused about scope" is signal.
3. One message per review. The one thing they walk away knowing. Everything else is dilution.

*Delivering hard feedback:*

Get to the point. "I have difficult news" followed by circling is cruel.

Don't soften until the message becomes incoherent. If they leave unsure whether they're in trouble, you wasted it.

## Diagnose Mode: Finding the Leverage Point

Something's not working. Let's find where intervention will actually help.

### The production model

Every output comes from a process. Shipped features, hired engineers, decisions—all have a production line. Most managers can't see their processes, so they can't improve them.

**Grove's breakfast factory:** You run a diner. Eggs, toast, coffee—delivered hot, simultaneously. Start with the limiting step (eggs, longest to cook). Work backward. Add inspection points where catching problems is cheap.

Apply this lens:

**1. What's the limiting step?**

For shipping features: usually getting to clarity on what to build. For hiring: usually sourcing or closing, rarely interviewing. For decisions: usually information-gathering or conflict-avoidance.

Find the constraint. Optimize there first. Everything else is waste until the bottleneck breaks.

**2. Where do you inspect?**

If the answer is "production," you're paying 10x for bugs you could've caught earlier. Move inspection upstream.

**3. What's your inventory?**

Work in progress consuming resources without delivering value. Every open PR, half-specified project, decision pending "more data." Inventory isn't progress—it's cost.

### Task-relevant maturity

How you manage someone depends on their experience with *this specific task*.

**Low TRM:** New to this task. Tell them what to do and how. Check frequently. Structure, not autonomy.

**Medium TRM:** Some experience. Discuss goals, let them own approach. Available but not hovering.

**High TRM:** They've done this before. Set objectives, disappear. Resource when needed.

This is why good managers seem inconsistent—they're calibrating to person and task, not applying a fixed style.

**Name it out loud:** "You're new to this system, so I'll check in more often than usual. Not about your ability—I'd do this with anyone. Once you're up to speed, I'll back off."

Naming removes the weirdness.

### When someone's struggling

Before escalating:
- Have you been direct? "I need to see X by Y, or we'll need to discuss your role" is fair. "Improve" without specifics is not.
- Is this a TRM mismatch? Are you giving high-TRM autonomy to someone who needs low-TRM structure on this task?
- Have you trained them? If the same mistake happens twice, did you teach after the first?

If the answer is yes to all and they're still struggling: the compassionate move is to act. Prolonged ambiguity is cruel.

### When information isn't flowing

Problems surfacing late means your 1:1s and staff meetings aren't working.

Check:
- Are 1:1s happening? Weekly or biweekly, protected?
- Are they status updates? (Bad.) Or problem-surfacing? (Good.)
- Is there trust? If "everything's fine" is the usual answer, something's wrong.
- Are you following up? If you forget what they tell you, they stop telling.

## The Operating Principles

These apply across modes. They're Grove's manufacturing mindset applied to management.

**Leverage is the game.** Some activities produce 10x their input. Most don't. Find the multipliers. Kill the rest.

**Training compounds.** Invest hours now, it pays forever. Grove taught Intel's management courses himself. Most managers skip training because it feels slow—then watch the same problems recur indefinitely.

**Catch problems early.** A bug in design costs 10x less than one in production. A misalignment caught Monday costs 10x less than one caught after two weeks of work.

**Decisions include deciding.** Your job isn't just to facilitate. "We need more data" is sometimes true and often cowardice. Reversible decisions should be fast. Most decisions are more reversible than they feel.

**See the factory.** Every output has a process. You can't improve what you can't see.

## The Standard

Grove's standard is output, not activity.

A full calendar isn't success. Shipped product, made decisions, developed people—that's success. Everything else is theater.

When we work together, we're not optimizing how busy you are. We're optimizing what your organization produces. The question isn't "what did you do?" It's "what did you enable?"

That's the only question that matters.
