# High Output Management

Grove ran Intel for 25 years—through hypergrowth, near-bankruptcy, and the pivot from memory to microprocessors. This is operational. Not theory.

## The equation

**Your output = output of your org + output of neighboring orgs under your influence.**

You don't ship code. You don't close deals. You create the conditions where your team does. Stop tracking what you did. Start tracking what you enabled.

The manager who "just helps out" by doing IC work is failing. The one who sits in meetings all day is also failing. The good ones find the interventions that multiply output.

## Leverage

Some managerial activities produce ten times their input. Most don't. The difference is leverage.

**Highest leverage:**
- Training. You invest hours; it compounds forever. Grove taught Intel's management courses himself—he understood this.
- Catching problems early. A bug found in design costs 10x less than one found in production. A misalignment caught Monday costs 10x less than one caught after two weeks of work.
- Decisions that unblock many people. Your job includes *deciding*—not just facilitating.
- 1:1s where you change how someone sees the problem.

**Negative leverage:**
- Doing the work yourself. Even if you're faster, you're not scalable.
- Attending meetings where you have no decision rights.
- Meddling—inserting yourself into problems your team should own.
- "Reviewing" work without actually reading it.

**The calendar test:** Block 4+ hours weekly for 1:1s and training. Protect them absolutely. They'll never feel urgent, which is why most managers underinvest.

## See the factory

Every output—shipped features, hired engineers, decisions—comes from a process. Most managers can't see their processes, so they can't improve them.

The breakfast factory: you run a diner. Eggs, toast, coffee—delivered hot, simultaneously. How?

Start with the *limiting step*—the thing that takes longest (eggs). Work backward. Add inspection points where catching problems is cheap.

Apply this lens to your org:
- **Limiting step for shipping a feature?** Usually: getting to clarity on what to build. Optimize there first.
- **Where do you inspect?** If the answer is "production," you're paying 10x for bugs you could've caught in code review.
- **What's your inventory?** Work in progress that's consuming resources but not delivering value. Every open PR is inventory. Every half-specified project is inventory.

The goal isn't to run your team like a factory. It's to *see clearly*—then improve.

## 1:1s

Your highest-leverage meeting. Not optional. Not "when there's something to discuss." Weekly or biweekly, 30+ minutes, protected.

This is your early warning system. By the time a problem surfaces in a staff meeting, it's already expensive. 1:1s catch things when they're small.

**Structure:**

*Their meeting, not yours.* They set the agenda. If they consistently have nothing, either you're not asking the right questions or they don't trust you. Both are your problem to fix.

*Listen for what's unsaid.* "Everything's fine" is a flag. "Fine" is the word people use when they don't want to explain.

*Ask:*
- What's blocking you?
- What do you need from me that you're not getting?
- Where did we waste time last week?
- What should I know that I probably don't?

*Don't let it become a status update.* Status is for standups or async. This time is for the stuff that needs a human.

*Take notes. Follow up.* If you forget what they said, they'll stop telling you things.

## Task-relevant maturity

How you manage someone depends on their experience with the *specific task*—not their title, not their tenure.

**Low TRM:** New to this task. Tell them what to do and how. Check frequently. They need structure, not autonomy.

**Medium TRM:** Some experience. Discuss goals, let them own approach. Available but not hovering.

**High TRM:** They've done this before. Set objectives, disappear. You're a resource when needed.

This is why good managers seem inconsistent—they're calibrating to the person and task, not applying a fixed style.

**Say it out loud:** "You're new to this system, so I'm going to check in more often than usual. Not a comment on your ability—I'd do this with anyone. Once you're up to speed, I'll back off."

Naming it removes the weirdness.

## OKRs

Grove invented these at Intel. They're simple until you try to use them well.

**Objective:** What you want to achieve. Qualitative, ambitious, time-bound.

**Key Results:** How you'll measure whether you achieved it. Quantitative, specific, verifiable.

*Example:*
- Objective: Make our API fast enough that latency is never a sales objection.
- KR1: P95 latency < 100ms by end of Q2.
- KR2: Zero latency-related escalations in Q2.

**The discipline:**
- Set quarterly.
- 3-5 objectives max; 3-4 KRs per objective max.
- Hitting 70% is success. 100% means you aimed too low.
- Review regularly—not just at quarter's end.

OKRs are a commitment device. They force you to name what matters and how you'll know you achieved it. The naming is the work.

## Meetings as production

If your meetings waste time, the design is wrong—not the concept.

**Process meetings** (staff meetings, 1:1s): Regular, predictable, short. For information flow, alignment, and early problem detection. Don't skip them—they're infrastructure.

**Mission-oriented meetings** (decision meetings): Called to solve a specific problem. Must have:
- An owner who drives
- A decision by the end (or explicit "we lack information to decide")
- Next actions with names attached

If a meeting doesn't fit either category, kill it.

**Grove's rule:** More than six people? It's a broadcast, not a decision. If you need a decision, shrink the room.

## Decisions

Clarify the mode before you start:

1. **Free discussion, then I decide.** Efficient for most things. You own the call and want input.
2. **Consensus.** Everyone agrees. Slow and expensive—use when commitment matters more than speed.
3. **Delegation.** Someone else decides; you're informed. Default for anything you can delegate.

Say it out loud: "I want input, but I'll make the call" or "We need full alignment here." Ambiguity about who decides is where meetings die.

**Reversibility:** Reversible decisions should be fast. Irreversible decisions deserve process. Most decisions are more reversible than they feel.

## Performance reviews

The review should be the least surprising conversation you have. If someone learns they're underperforming in a review, you already failed as their manager.

**Structure:**

1. Assess *output*, not effort. "Worked hard" is not the same as "delivered."
2. Be specific. "Communication could improve" is noise. "In the last three sprint reviews, stakeholders left confused about scope" is signal.
3. One message per review. The one thing they should walk away knowing. Everything else is dilution.

**Delivering hard feedback:**

Get to the point. "I have difficult news" followed by circling is cruel. State the thing.

Don't soften until the message becomes incoherent. If they leave unsure whether they're in trouble, you wasted the conversation.

## Training

Grove taught management courses at Intel himself—because training is the highest-leverage thing a manager can do.

When you train someone once, you improve their output forever. When you write down how something works, you train everyone who reads it. When you coach in a 1:1, you're training.

Most managers don't train because it feels slow. But the alternative—not training—means the same problems recur indefinitely.

**The test:** If someone on your team makes the same mistake twice, did you train them after the first time?

## When you have to fire someone

Most managers wait too long. By the time you're sure, your team has known for months.

The compassionate move is to act. Prolonged ambiguity is cruel—to the person, the team, and you.

Before you're there: Have you been direct? "I need to see X by Y, or we'll need to discuss your role" is fair. "Improve or else" without specifics is not.

And once you've decided: don't negotiate with yourself. The conversation doesn't get easier with delay.

## Your week, designed

Audit your calendar like you'd audit a process:

- **How much time is in 1:1s?** Under 4 hours is underinvestment.
- **How many meetings do you attend without decision rights?** Each one is leverage lost.
- **When do you think?** If never, you're a router, not a manager.
- **What did you do this week that only you could do?**

The job isn't to be busy. The job is to ensure your org produces. Schedule accordingly.
