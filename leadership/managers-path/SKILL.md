description: Fournier's guide for engineers who suddenly have to manage people. Activate when an engineer gets promoted and starts drowning, when you miss shipping code, or when you're tempted to just fix it yourself because it would be faster. You were good at your old job. This is a different job.

# The Manager's Path

You were an engineer. You were good at it. You could look at a problem, break it down, solve it, ship it, feel the satisfaction of something working that didn't work before.

Now you're a manager. And almost none of that applies.

---

## When to Use This

- You're an engineer who just got promoted and miss shipping
- You're watching a new eng manager drown in their role
- You're considering the jump and not sure what the job actually is

**The uncomfortable truth:** Management isn't a promotion. It's a career change. You're becoming a beginner at something else.

---

## The Core Problem

Engineers solve problems. You see something broken, you fix it. The feedback loop is tight: code works or it doesn't. Ship and feel good.

Management breaks all of that.

You can't fix people like you fix code. You can't debug motivation. You can't refactor someone's confidence. And the worst part: you *could* still write that code faster than teaching someone else to do it. The temptation never fully goes away.

Fournier's insight: each level up the ladder is a completely different job. The skills that made you excellent at the last level are almost useless at this one. You're not building on your strengths—you're starting over.

The discomfort you feel isn't impostor syndrome. It's the accurate recognition that you don't know how to do this job yet.

---

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Transition mode** — "I'm stepping into a new level and drowning"
- **Diagnose mode** — "Something's wrong and I can't name it"
- **Decide mode** — "I'm not sure if I want this"

## Transition Mode: The Job Just Changed Completely

You got promoted. Congratulations. Now forget everything that worked before.

### Engineer → Tech Lead

**What you think the job is:** Senior engineer with more responsibility.

**What the job actually is:** You're still coding, but now you're responsible for technical decisions you don't personally make. You lead through influence with people who don't report to you. Your value isn't the code you write—it's the bad code you prevent.

**The engineer's trap:**
You see a hard problem. You know you can solve it faster than anyone. So you do. Then you do it again. Now you're the bottleneck, and everyone else has stopped growing because you're always in the way.

**The questions that reveal if you're stuck:**
- If you got sick for two weeks, would any project actually continue?
- When's the last time someone made a technical decision you disagreed with—and you let it stand?
- Are you the only one who can debug production? Is that a problem or a point of pride?

**What has to change:**
From "I'll do this because I'm best at it" to "How do I make someone else good enough to do this?"

You have to let them struggle. It's slower. It feels wasteful. That's the job now.

### Tech Lead → Manager

**What you think the job is:** Tech lead with hiring and 1:1s added.

**What the job actually is:** You don't solve technical problems anymore. You solve *people* problems so that *people* can solve technical problems. Your output is their output. Your wins come through others.

**The engineer's trap:**
You're still the smartest technical person in the room, and you can't resist proving it. Your 1:1s are status updates. You store feedback for quarterly reviews instead of saying it now. You take over when things get hard because watching someone struggle feels inefficient.

**The questions that reveal if you're stuck:**
- Can you name each report's biggest frustration *right now*? Not their project status—their frustration.
- When's the last time you gave critical feedback within 48 hours of the behavior?
- In your 1:1s, who talks more?
- When's the last time you jumped in to solve a technical problem and immediately regretted it?

**The 1:1 test:**
If your 1:1s are status updates, you're using the wrong meeting. Status is async. 1:1s are for the things they won't say in Slack.

**What has to change:**
From "How do I solve this?" to "How do I help them solve this, and grow from solving it?"

The dopamine hit of shipping is gone. Forever. Some people never adjust. That's okay—but know it going in.

### Manager → Manager of Managers

**What you think the job is:** Manager with more scope.

**What the job actually is:** Information is now two hops away. You don't know what ICs are doing day-to-day. You're operating on delayed, filtered data. Your job is to grow your managers—their leadership capacity is your team's capacity.

**The engineer's trap:**
When things go wrong, you go direct to the ICs and fix it yourself. Faster! More accurate! You just undercut your manager and taught everyone that you're the real boss.

**The questions that reveal if you're stuck:**
- When was your last skip-level? What surprised you?
- Which of your managers needs help with feedback? With prioritization? With 1:1s?
- Do your managers bring you problems or solutions?
- Are you solving problems your managers should be solving?

**What has to change:**
From managing ICs to growing managers who manage ICs. You're now one more step removed from the work. Get used to it.

### Director and Beyond

**What you think the job is:** Bigger scope, more influence.

**What the job actually is:** Organizational design. You're not managing individuals anymore—you're designing systems that produce outcomes. Teams, structures, incentives, communication channels.

**The engineer's trap:**
You mandate technical decisions you don't fully understand. Or worse: you lose touch with the technology entirely and can't smell bullshit anymore.

**The questions that reveal if you're stuck:**
- When's the last time you read a design doc? Did a code review?
- Can you still tell when an estimate is wrong?
- Are you solving individual performance problems when the real issue is organizational?

**Fournier's warning:** You'll write less code every year until you stop entirely. Some directors maintain technical credibility. Most don't. Decide which you're going to be and commit.

## Diagnose Mode: What's Actually Wrong

Someone's struggling. Let's figure out where.

### The core diagnostic

Ask them: "What was your job before? What is it now? What's the difference?"

If they can't answer clearly, that's the problem. They're trying to do their old job plus some new stuff, and it's crushing them.

### The three failure patterns

**1. They're still doing their old job**

The tech lead who's in every code review. The manager who still solves the hardest technical problems. The director who's managing ICs directly.

Ask: "What have you stopped doing since the promotion?" If they can't name anything, that's the answer.

**2. They added the new job without dropping the old**

Working 70 hours. In every meeting. Feeling indispensable (which means they've built themselves into a single point of failure).

Ask: "What would break if you disappeared for two weeks?" If the answer is "everything," they're not delegating.

**3. They're avoiding the hard parts**

The manager who hasn't had a difficult feedback conversation in months. The director who keeps solving technical problems because org problems are uncomfortable. The manager of managers who never does skip-levels.

Ask: "What conversation are you avoiding?" Name it. Schedule it.

### The meta-problem

Each level requires a new identity. They're not getting better at their old job—they're learning a new one. It feels like starting over because it is.

---

## Decide Mode: Should You Even Do This?

Management isn't for everyone. That's not a consolation prize—it's a fact.

### The real question

Not "do I want to advance?" but "do I want *this specific job*?"

Managing means:
- Wins through others, not through your own hands
- Constant context-switching, not deep focus
- Emotional labor as a core requirement
- Second-order technical problems (you help people who solve the problems)

Some excellent engineers become mediocre managers because they miss shipping. That's not failure—it's fit.

### The staff+ alternative

Staff and principal engineer tracks are real now. You can advance without managing people. The question isn't "up or out"—it's "which kind of work do you actually want?"

### The warning Fournier gives

People can tell when their manager wishes they were coding. If someone takes management reluctantly, they'll do it reluctantly. Their reports will feel it.

Don't do this because it's the "next step." Do it because you actually want to grow people.

## Quick Reference

### The engineer's traps by level

| Level | The trap | How it feels |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Tech Lead | Doing all the hard work yourself | Productive but exhausting |
| Manager | Solving technical problems instead of people problems | Competent but not managing |
| Manager of Managers | Going direct to ICs when things break | Heroic but undermining |
| Director+ | Losing technical credibility, or micromanaging | Lost or controlling |

### Questions for any transition

1. What was your job? What is it now?
2. What have you stopped doing?
3. What are you avoiding?
4. What would break if you disappeared?

### The Fournier test

Is the organization getting what it needs from someone at this level?

Not what you're good at. Not what you enjoy. Not what worked before. What does this role actually require—and are you doing it?

## The Voice

Fournier writes like an engineer who figured this out the hard way. Direct, practical, occasionally rueful. She knows the temptation to just fix the code yourself—she's felt it. She knows the grief of giving up technical mastery—she's mourned it.

The book isn't aspirational. It's survival guidance for engineers who suddenly have to care about feelings, politics, and organizational design—things they spent their whole career avoiding.

If you're reading this skill, you're probably in that transition. The discomfort is correct. You're learning a new job. Give yourself the time you'd give any beginner.
