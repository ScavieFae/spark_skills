# The Manager's Path

Every level requires abandoning what made you successful at the previous one.

## The core problem

You got promoted because you were good at something. Now that thing isn't your job anymore.

ICs succeed by solving problems. Tech leads succeed by guiding solutions. Managers succeed by growing the people who solve problems. Each transition means doing less of what you're good at and more of what you're not good at yet.

This never feels natural. The discomfort is the job.

## Tech Lead (still an IC, now responsible for more)

You're still coding, but you're also responsible for your team's technical direction. You don't have formal authority—you lead through influence.

The trap: doing all the hard technical work yourself because it's faster. It is faster. But you've become a bottleneck, and nobody else is growing.

Your job is to make technical decisions that stick, break down ambiguous projects into pieces others can take, and unblock people without taking over. You still need to write code, but increasingly your value is in the code you prevent others from writing badly.

Warning sign: you're in every code review, every design decision, every outage. You've become the team's single point of failure dressed up as the team's best engineer.

## The management decision

Not everyone should manage. The question isn't "do I want to advance?" It's "do I want this specific job?"

Managing means: your wins come through others. Your day is meetings, context-switching, and emotional labor. Technical problems become second-order—you're solving people problems so people can solve technical problems.

Some excellent engineers become mediocre managers because they miss the dopamine hit of shipping. That's fine. The industry has finally accepted that staff+ tracks are real. Choose the work you actually want to do.

But don't manage reluctantly. People can tell when their manager wishes they were coding.

## Engineering Manager (people are now the job)

You're responsible for a team of ICs. Their output is your output. Their growth is your responsibility. Their frustrations land on you.

The 1:1 is your primary tool. Weekly. Non-negotiable. But most managers do them badly:

- **Status updates are not 1:1s.** That's what standups and written check-ins are for. If you're spending 1:1s on project status, you're wasting the time.
- **Therapy sessions are not 1:1s.** Listening to venting is fine sometimes. But your job is to help them navigate work, not to be their friend.
- **Your agenda comes second.** The meeting is for them. They set the topics. You create space for what's actually going on—the stuff they wouldn't say in Slack.

Good 1:1 questions: What's frustrating you? What do you wish you were doing more of? What's something I should know that I probably don't? Where do you want to be in a year?

Listen for: what they're not saying, what they're avoiding, what lights them up, what drains them.

**Feedback.** Most managers give too little too late.

Don't store up feedback for quarterly reviews. The behavior happened six months ago; now it's abstract and resentful. Give feedback close to the event. Be specific about behavior, not character. "You interrupted three times in that meeting" is actionable. "You're not a good listener" is an attack.

Praise is feedback too. Most managers under-praise. Call out good work when you see it. Be specific about what was good.

**Managing former peers.** If you were promoted from within, you're now managing people who were your equals yesterday. This is hard in specific ways:

- You know who you used to gossip with. You can't anymore.
- You have information they don't have. You can't share most of it.
- You have to give them honest feedback. No more mutual venting.
- Some will resent it. You can't fix that by pretending nothing changed.

Have the direct conversation: "This is weird, and I want to acknowledge it. I'm still figuring out this role. My job is to support you, and I want to know if the dynamic ever feels off."

Then follow through. Be fair. Don't overcompensate by being soft on them or hard on them. Just be consistent.

## Manager of Managers (information is now two hops away)

Your ICs are managers. You don't know what their ICs are doing day-to-day. You're running on delayed and filtered information. This changes everything.

You can't debug problems by walking over to someone's desk. You can't tell if a team is struggling until it's already bad. You have to build systems for getting accurate information—and you have to resist the temptation to skip your managers and go direct to their reports.

Skip-levels are your tool here. Meet with your reports' reports regularly. Not to manage them—to learn what's really happening and to let them know you're accessible.

Your actual job: grow your managers. Their leadership capacity is your team's capacity. If they can't give feedback, you need to teach them. If they can't run 1:1s, you need to coach them. If they're drowning, you need to help them prioritize.

The trap: doing your managers' jobs for them. It's faster. But now they're not learning, you're overloaded, and you've created dependency.

## Director/VP/CTO (organizational problems)

At this level, your job is organizational design. Teams, structures, communication channels, incentive systems. The problems are systemic.

"Debugging teams" is a real skill. When a team is struggling, look for patterns:

- **Unclear goals**: People are working hard on things that don't matter. Ship deadlines without success metrics. Nobody knows what winning looks like.
- **Mistrust**: People hoard information. Credit is hoarded, blame is displaced. Cover-your-ass behavior.
- **Wrong people**: Not enough skill, not enough seniority, too much conflict, or just a bad fit.
- **Process theater**: Lots of meetings, lots of artifacts, not much output. Process substituting for judgment.
- **Missing communication**: Assumptions instead of alignment. Teams shipping in different directions.

Don't assume the team is the problem. Often the team is responding rationally to broken incentives. Fix the system before you blame the people.

**Staying technical.** The ladder pulls you away from code. You'll write less each year. At some point, you'll stop entirely.

But you can't lead technical organizations without technical understanding. Stay close enough to evaluate architectural decisions, smell bullshit in estimations, and participate in technical debates. This doesn't mean coding on the critical path—it means reading designs, doing code reviews occasionally, and staying current on the stack.

The failure mode: mandating technical decisions you don't understand, or delegating everything technical and becoming a non-technical manager of engineers. Both erode credibility and lead to bad decisions.

## Hiring

Bad hiring compounds. One wrong hire poisons a team for months.

Structure the process. Define what you're looking for before you see candidates. Use consistent questions and rubrics. Debrief while memory is fresh.

Don't over-index on technical trivia. The best engineers often don't do well on whiteboard puzzles. Look for: problem-solving approach, communication, self-awareness, growth trajectory.

Check references. Actually check them. Ask specific questions: "What would make this person fail here? What do they struggle with? Would you hire them again?"

Sell the job. The best candidates have options. Know why your team is a good bet for them specifically. If you can't articulate it, figure it out before you start recruiting.

## The meta-skill

Each level requires a new identity. The manager who was a great IC has to stop being an IC. The VP who was a great manager has to stop managing directly.

This is loss. You're giving up something you were good at. It doesn't feel like a promotion; it feels like starting over.

The ones who make each transition are the ones who can let go. The ones who can't end up as bottlenecks, doing their old job badly while neglecting their new one.

The question at every level: what is my job now, really? Not what it was. Not what I'm good at. What does the organization need from this role?

Answer that, and the rest follows.
