# The Manager's Path

The discomfort you feel after a promotion isn't impostor syndrome.
It's the correct recognition that you don't know how to do this job yet.

---

## When to Use This

**You just got promoted:**
- "I used to be good at my job. Now I'm not sure what my job is."
- Everything takes longer. You're doing your old work plus new work you don't understand yet.
- You miss the dopamine of shipping.

**You're stuck in transition:**
- The skills that got you here aren't working anymore.
- You're the bottleneck but can't figure out what to stop doing.
- Your calendar is full but nothing important is happening.

**You're diagnosing what's broken:**
- A team or manager is struggling and you can't pinpoint why.
- You're sensing dysfunction but can't name it.
- Someone's failing in a role they should be good at.

**You're coaching someone through transition:**
- A report just got promoted and is flailing.
- An IC is considering management but doesn't understand what they're signing up for.
- A manager is doing their old job instead of their new one.

## The Core Problem

You got promoted because you were good at something. Now that thing isn't your job anymore.

ICs succeed by solving problems. Tech leads succeed by guiding solutions. Managers succeed by growing the people who solve problems. Directors succeed by designing organizations that grow managers.

Each transition means doing less of what you're good at. The discomfort isn't a bug—it's the job. If it feels natural, you're probably not doing it.

---

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Diagnose mode** — "I'm struggling in my role, or watching someone else struggle"
- **Transition mode** — "I'm moving into a new level and need to understand the shift"
- **Coach mode** — "I'm helping someone else navigate their transition"

---

## Diagnose Mode: What Level Is Actually Broken?

Something isn't working. Let's figure out where.

### First: What level are we talking about?

| Level | Your job is to... | You fail when... |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Tech Lead | Guide technical direction without authority | You do all the hard work yourself |
| Manager | Grow the people who solve problems | You solve the problems yourself |
| Manager of Managers | Grow your managers' leadership capacity | You manage their reports for them |
| Director+ | Design organizations and systems | You manage individuals instead of systems |

### The diagnostic questions

**What are you spending time on?**

Track a week honestly. Where does the time actually go? Now compare:

- Tech Lead should be: 50%+ coding, architecture decisions, unblocking, cross-team alignment
- Manager should be: 1:1s, feedback, hiring, shielding team from chaos
- Manager of Managers should be: growing managers, skip-levels, org design, strategy
- Director+ should be: organizational problems, executive alignment, long-term planning

If you're spending time one level down, you're doing your old job. Comfortable but wrong.

**What's the failure pattern?**

| You're probably at... | If you're failing by... |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Tech Lead | Being in every code review, every design, every outage |
| Manager | Storing up feedback for quarterly reviews; status-update 1:1s |
| Manager of Managers | Not knowing what your ICs are struggling with |
| Director+ | Making technical decisions you don't understand; mandating without context |

**What are you avoiding?**

The thing you're avoiding is usually your actual job:

- Tech Lead avoiding: letting go of the hardest technical problems
- Manager avoiding: the difficult feedback conversation
- Manager of Managers avoiding: telling a manager they're not ready
- Director+ avoiding: the org change that would fix the problem

Name it. That's probably where the work is.

## Transition Mode: The Level-Specific Shift

You're moving into a new level. Let's get specific about what changes.

### Tech Lead: Still an IC, Now Responsible for More

**What changes:**
- You're still coding. But now you're also responsible for your team's technical direction.
- You lead through influence, not authority.
- Your value shifts from the code you write to the code you prevent others from writing badly.

**The trap:**
Doing all the hard work yourself because it's faster. It is faster. You've become the bottleneck dressed up as the team's best engineer.

**The questions to ask yourself:**
1. Could any project continue if you got sick for two weeks?
2. Are you the single point of failure for any system or decision?
3. Is anyone else growing into harder technical work, or is that still you?
4. When was the last time someone else made a technical decision you disagreed with—and you let it stand?

**The shift:**
From "I'll do this because I'm best at it" to "How do I make others better at this?"

### Manager: People Are Now the Job

**What changes:**
- Your output is their output. Their growth is your responsibility.
- Technical problems become second-order. You solve people problems so people can solve technical problems.
- The dopamine hit of shipping is gone. Your wins come through others.

**The trap:**
Treating 1:1s as status updates. Storing feedback for quarterly reviews. Still trying to be the smartest technical person in the room.

**The questions to ask yourself:**
1. What's the last piece of critical feedback you gave within 48 hours of the behavior?
2. Can you name each report's biggest frustration right now?
3. Are your 1:1s driven by their agenda or yours?
4. When was the last time you resisted jumping in to solve a technical problem yourself?

**The 1:1 diagnostic:**
- Status updates in 1:1s = you're using the wrong meeting
- You're talking more than they are = you're doing it wrong
- You can't remember anything surprising from last month's 1:1s = they're not telling you what's real

**The shift:**
From "How do I solve this?" to "How do I help them solve this, and grow from solving it?"

### Manager of Managers: Information Is Two Hops Away

**What changes:**
- You don't know what ICs are doing day-to-day. You're running on delayed and filtered information.
- Your job is to grow your managers. Their leadership capacity is your team's capacity.
- Skip-levels become essential—not to manage around your managers, but to learn what's actually happening.

**The trap:**
Doing your managers' jobs for them. Going direct to ICs when things get hard. Optimizing for speed over manager growth.

**The questions to ask yourself:**
1. When was your last skip-level? What did you learn that surprised you?
2. Which of your managers needs coaching on giving feedback? On running 1:1s? On prioritizing?
3. Are you solving problems your managers should be solving?
4. Do your managers come to you with solutions or with problems?

**The shift:**
From managing ICs to growing managers who manage ICs.

### Director and Above: Organizational Problems

**What changes:**
- Your job is organizational design. Teams, structures, communication channels, incentive systems.
- The problems are systemic. Individual performance matters less than whether the system produces good outcomes.
- You'll write less code every year until you stop entirely.

**The trap:**
Managing individuals instead of systems. Mandating technical decisions you don't understand. Losing touch with the technology until you can't smell bullshit.

**The questions to ask yourself:**
1. What organizational structure would make this problem go away?
2. Are people responding rationally to broken incentives?
3. When's the last time you read a design doc or did a code review?
4. Can you still tell when an estimate is bullshit?

**Debugging a team:**
- Unclear goals: People working hard on things that don't matter
- Mistrust: Information hoarding, credit hoarding, CYA behavior
- Wrong people: Skill gaps, seniority gaps, bad fits
- Process theater: Lots of meetings, lots of artifacts, no output
- Missing communication: Assumptions instead of alignment

Don't blame people first. Check if they're responding rationally to broken systems.

## Coach Mode: Helping Someone Else Through

Someone you work with is struggling in a transition. Let's help.

### The core question to ask them

"What was your job before? What is your job now? What's the difference?"

Most struggling people can't answer this clearly. Helping them articulate the shift is half the work.

### The usual failure modes to look for

**They're doing their old job:**
- The tech lead who's still writing all the critical code
- The manager who's still solving the hardest technical problems
- The manager of managers who's managing ICs directly

Ask: "What have you stopped doing since the promotion?" If they can't name anything, that's the problem.

**They're adding the new job without dropping the old:**
- Working 70 hours and drowning
- In every meeting, every review, every decision
- Feeling indispensable (which means they've created a bottleneck)

Ask: "What would break if you disappeared for two weeks?" If the answer is "everything," they're not delegating.

**They're avoiding the hard parts:**
- The manager who hasn't had a difficult feedback conversation in months
- The director who keeps solving technical problems instead of org problems
- The manager of managers who never does skip-levels

Ask: "What's the conversation you're avoiding?" Name it. Schedule it.

### The meta-skill to teach

Each level requires a new identity. They're not getting better at their old job—they're learning a new one. It feels like starting over because it is.

The question isn't "how do I get better?" The question is "what does the organization actually need from this role?"

---

## The Management Decision

Not everyone should manage. Before someone transitions:

**The real question:**
Not "do I want to advance?" but "do I want this specific job?"

Managing means: wins through others, constant context-switching, emotional labor, second-order technical problems. Some excellent engineers become mediocre managers because they miss shipping.

Staff+ tracks are real now. The question is: which work do you actually want?

**The warning sign:**
People can tell when their manager wishes they were coding. If someone takes management reluctantly, they'll do it reluctantly.

## Quick Reference

### Level-by-level failure modes

| Level | The trap | The tell |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Tech Lead | Doing all the hard work yourself | You're in every code review and design |
| Manager | Status-update 1:1s, late feedback | Can't name each report's current frustration |
| Manager of Managers | Managing ICs directly, skipping your managers | Last skip-level was months ago |
| Director+ | Mandating without context, losing technical touch | Can't smell a bad estimate anymore |

### The transition questions

At any level, ask:
1. What was your job? What is it now?
2. What have you stopped doing?
3. What are you avoiding?
4. What would break if you disappeared?

### Good 1:1 questions

- What's frustrating you?
- What do you wish you were doing more of?
- What's something I should know that I probably don't?
- Where do you want to be in a year?

### The standard

Fournier's standard: Is the organization getting what it needs from you at this level?

Not what you're good at. Not what you enjoy. Not what worked before. What does this role require, and are you doing it?

Answer that honestly, and the rest follows.
