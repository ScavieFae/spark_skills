# Bird by Bird

This isn't about craft. It's about not quitting.

## Shitty first drafts are the only kind

All first drafts are bad. All of them.

The writers you admire? Their first drafts are terrible. The difference is they kept going. They didn't wait to write well. They wrote badly, then fixed it.

Your first draft is you telling yourself the story. Compost. Raw material. The pressure to be good on the first pass—that's the thing that freezes you. Not lack of skill. Expectation.

So: write badly. On purpose. Three terrible pages. One scene that barely coheres. Get the clay on the table. You can't sculpt nothing.

## The one-inch picture frame

When you're overwhelmed: shrink the frame.

Not "write this chapter." Write what you can see through a one-inch frame. One moment. One image. What does the room smell like? What's she not saying? What would he have in his pockets?

You don't need to know where it's going. You need to write the next true sentence. Then the one after that.

Most paralysis is scope creep. You're trying to solve the whole book. You can't. Shrink the frame until the task becomes possible. Then do that.

## Bird by bird

A ten-year-old with a report on birds due tomorrow, frozen by how much there is.

"Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird."

That's the whole method. Don't write the book. Write this scene. Don't write the scene. Write this paragraph. Don't know the paragraph? Describe one thing you noticed.

The finished work is accumulated fragments. You can't see the whole until you've written enough pieces to discover it.

## The voices will come

You sit down and immediately hear: *This is stupid. You're not a real writer. Someone else said this better. Who do you think you are?*

These voices are not you. They're old programming—critics, parents, that one teacher. They show up every time. Every time. The practice isn't silencing them. The practice is writing anyway.

Lamott shrinks them down, imagines putting them in a jar, watching them mouth their criticisms silently while she works.

Name them. Externalize them. Then ignore them. They don't get a vote.

## Perfectionism is not high standards

Perfectionism isn't pursuit of excellence. It's pursuit of reasons not to start.

It disguises itself as quality control. *I'll start when I know what I'm doing. I need to research more. I'll write when I have time to do it right.* Meanwhile: nothing written. Nothing learned. The voice wins.

The standard for a first draft is *existing*. Polish is for revision four. The beautiful sentence you're imagining lives in the tenth draft—but you can't get there without a bad first draft to revise.

Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor. Tell it to shut up and write your three bad pages.

## Finding your material

"Write what you know" doesn't mean autobiography.

Write from emotional truths. The way your family argued. What you've noticed about grief, envy, pretending. The textures of your life—not the events, the feelings.

Your material isn't what happened. It's what you paid attention to. What you remember with strange clarity. The details that stuck for reasons you don't understand.

That's where the writing lives. Not in the dramatic moments. In the small things you can't stop thinking about.

## Character: know them beyond the plot

Before you write a character, know them.

What's in their pockets right now? How do they order coffee? What do they lie about? What can they not forgive? What do they want more than anything?

The plot is what happens. The character is who it happens to. Know them well enough and they'll make choices you didn't plan. Follow them. That's when the writing gets alive.

Dialogue: not what's said—what's withheld. Subtext. Interruptions. The way people talk around the thing instead of at it.

## The practice

Not a productivity hack. The willingness to show up and feel bad for a while.

Roughly the same time every day. Expect nothing. Write three hundred words. Some days they come, some days they don't. Either way: you showed up.

Butt in chair. Hands on keys. That's the discipline. Not "write well." Write anyway.

## When you're stuck

1. Shrink the frame. One-inch. What can you see?
2. Write the bad version. On purpose. Permission to be terrible.
3. Follow a character into a room. What do they notice first?
4. Describe what you actually remember—not what you should write.
5. Write about why you're stuck. Sometimes the block is the material.

Stuck is normal. Stuck is most of it. The writers who finish are the ones who write through stuck.

## The hard truth

Publication won't fix you. Success won't quiet the voices. Writers with ten books sit down to page one and feel like frauds.

The reward for writing is writing. If you need it to be something else, you'll chase forever.

This is the practice. It doesn't get easier. You get more willing.
