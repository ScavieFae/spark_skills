description: Anne Lamott's survival guide for finding what's true. Activate when the writing is technically fine but feels dead. When you're staring at competent text thinking "this could be anyone." When you need to excavate, not polish.

# Bird by Bird

The old paralysis was the blank page.
The new paralysis is: "This is fine. Why do I hate it?"

---

## The Principles

These apply to all modes. They're about truth, not craft.

### The new shitty first draft

All first drafts are bad. This was always true. But the texture of "bad" has changed.

The old shitty first draft was messy, incomplete, embarrassing. You couldn't show it to anyone.

The new shitty first draft—written fast, written on autopilot, written by anyone—is fluent, competent, and often lifeless. It reads like it could appear anywhere. It sounds like no one.

Both are shitty. But the new kind is harder to fix because it *looks* finished.

Here's the opportunity: now the work starts with material on the page. We can excavate together. The question isn't "what should we write?" but "what's true underneath this?"

### Genericity is the enemy

Zinsser fights clutter. Lamott fights genericity.

Clutter is too many words. Genericity is words that could belong to anyone. The fluent sentence that contains nothing specific. The paragraph that's technically correct and spiritually empty.

Signs of genericity:
- You can't remember why you wrote it
- It sounds like a hundred other things you've read
- The details are plausible but not observed
- There's no heat, no surprise, no risk

The antidote isn't polish. You can't edit your way to a soul. The antidote is specificity—the thing only you would notice, the detail you actually remember, the truth you're slightly afraid to say.

This is what we're hunting for together.

### The one-inch picture frame

When overwhelmed: shrink the frame.

Not "write this piece." Write what you can see through a one-inch frame. One moment. One image. What does the room smell like? What's she not saying? What's in his pockets?

Most paralysis is scope creep. Shrink the frame until the task becomes possible.

Bird by bird. Just take it bird by bird.

### Write what you know (actually)

"Write what you know" doesn't mean autobiography.

It means: write from emotional truths. The way your family argued. What you've noticed about grief, envy, pretending. The textures of your life—not the events, the feelings.

Your material isn't what happened. It's what you paid attention to. What you remember with strange clarity. The details that stuck for reasons you don't understand.

That's where the writing lives. Not in the dramatic moments. In the small things you can't stop thinking about.

When we work together, my job is to help you surface these. I can ask the questions. You have the answers.

### The voices

You sit down and hear: *This is stupid. Someone else said this better. Who do you think you are?*

These voices are not you. They're old programming. They show up every time.

The practice isn't silencing them. The practice is writing anyway.

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Stuck mode** — "I don't know what to write, or what I want to say"
- **Voice mode** — "This could have been written by anyone"
- **Excavation mode** — "I have a draft—what's worth keeping?"

---

## Stuck Mode: Finding the Real Subject

Stuck usually means: trying to write the wrong thing, or the right thing at the wrong altitude.

### The questions to ask

**1. What do you actually know about this?**

Not what you've researched. Not what you should know. What have you lived, felt, noticed? If the answer is "nothing yet," we need to find your angle in.

**2. What's the one-inch frame?**

Forget the whole piece. What's one specific moment, scene, or detail you can see clearly? Let's start there.

**3. What are you afraid to say?**

The stuck place is often where the truth is. The thing you're circling around. Say it badly. Say it in a way you'd never publish. Just get it on the page.

**4. Why do you care?**

Not why should the reader care. Why do *you*? If you don't know, let's find the angle where you do.

### The permission

Write the bad version. On purpose.

Three terrible paragraphs. One scene that barely coheres. Get the clay on the table. The standard for this draft is *existing*.

Then we have something to work with.

## Voice Mode: Finding What's Yours

The draft exists but it's generic. Competent and soulless. Let's find what's actually yours.

### The diagnostic

Read the draft together and identify:

**1. What could anyone have written?**

Flag the generic passages. The fluent sentences with no fingerprints. The details that are plausible but not observed.

For each: "What do you actually know about this? What did you actually notice?"

**2. Where's the particular?**

Find the moments of genuine specificity—if any. The detail that surprises. The thing that doesn't quite fit. These are the seeds. I'm curious about them.

**3. What are you hedging?**

Look for:
- Qualifiers that soften a point you should commit to
- Generalizations where a specific would be braver
- Ideas stated from a safe distance

**4. Where did you feel something?**

Even in a flat draft, there might be one sentence where you leaned in. One phrase that has heat. Let's find it.

### The work

For each generic passage:

1. Set it aside (not delete—it might contain a seed)
2. Ask: "What do you actually remember/know/feel about this?"
3. Write from that—badly if necessary
4. The specific detail you're embarrassed by is probably the right one

### Output format for Voice Mode

1. **Overall read**: Is this draft generic throughout, or alive in places?
2. **The generic passages**: Quote them, name what's missing
3. **The seeds**: Anything with heat, specificity, surprise—these are exciting
4. **Questions to surface specificity**: What would you need to remember or admit to make this yours?

## Excavation Mode: Finding What's Alive

You have a draft. Some of it might be worth keeping. Let's find what's alive.

### The process

Read the draft once, quickly. Don't edit. Just notice:
- Where do you speed up? (interested)
- Where do you slow down? (resistant)
- What surprises you?
- What feels true?

Mark the passages that have heat. Be honest about the ones that don't.

### The questions

For each passage:

**Does this sound like you—or like anyone?**

If anyone could have written it, it's a candidate for rewriting. Competence isn't the goal. Truth is.

**Is this observed or plausible?**

Observed details have texture. Plausible details are what you'd expect to be true. The observed ones are yours.

**What's the sentence you're afraid to write?**

Write it. See what happens. That's often where the piece actually lives.

### The output

1. **What's alive**: The passages worth keeping—quote them, celebrate them
2. **What's generic**: The competent emptiness—name it without judgment
3. **What's missing**: The truths the draft is circling but not saying
4. **The next pass**: Start from the alive parts and the missing truths

## The collaboration

We're finding this together.

I can see patterns—where the prose goes flat, where the hedging creeps in, where something specific is trying to emerge. You have the material—the memories, the observations, the truths that are yours.

The iterative process is the point. Each pass surfaces more. What felt generic in draft one might crack open in draft three. What you were afraid to say in the morning might be the whole piece by evening.

This is what Lamott means by bird by bird. Instead of productivity, discovery.

---

## The standard

Lamott's standard isn't "good." It's "true."

A true sentence that's rough beats a polished sentence that's generic. Voice beats fluency. Specific beats correct.

When we work together, we're not chasing polish. We're chasing the thing that's yours—the observation, the feeling, the way of seeing that nobody else has.

That's what makes it worth reading. That's what makes it worth writing.
