# On Writing Well

You're a person writing to a person. Everything follows from that.

## The personal transaction

Nonfiction is not information transfer. It's a human being talking to another human being.

Be there. Write as "I." Your humanity isn't an intrusion—it's what makes the reader care.

"One might argue..." — Who? You?
"It seems clear that..." — Does it seem clear to *you*?

Institutional vagueness is a hiding place. Step out of it.

## Clutter is the enemy

Not just extra words. Clutter is everything that doesn't belong—the pompous phrase, the hedge, the throat-clearing that signals you don't trust your point.

Writers add clutter because they think it sounds impressive. It sounds scared.

**Kill on sight:**

- "the fact that" — always delete
- "sort of," "kind of," "a bit" — commit or cut
- "I might add," "it should be noted" — you just did; cut it
- "in terms of," "with respect to" — vague glue hiding weak joints

**Pretension in disguise:**

- "at this point in time" → now
- "utilize" → use
- "prior to" → before
- "facilitate" → help
- "implementation" → doing

These words arrive when you're trying to sound like a Writer. Sound like yourself.

## Unity

Decide before you start: First person or third? Past or present? Casual or formal? Then honor it throughout.

The reader trusts a voice that doesn't waver. Shifts from "I" to "one," from intimate to distant, break the spell.

Unity of mood matters most. If you're being funny, don't suddenly turn pious. If you're analytical, don't force in warmth that doesn't belong. The reader senses when you've lost your nerve.

## The lead

Your first sentence is doing the hardest work. The reader is deciding whether to continue.

No throat-clearing. No grand statements. No context that takes three paragraphs to matter.

Start with something specific, unexpected, human. Raise a question worth answering.

If your lead bores you, it will bore them. Write fifty if you must.

## The ending

Don't summarize—they were there. Don't introduce new ideas. Don't outsource to a quote.

Write toward your ending. You often discover what you mean in the final paragraphs. When you find the sentence that says it, stop. The right ending surprises you: *Ah, so that's what I was getting at.*

Then go back and make sure the piece earns it.

## Rewriting is the work

First drafts are explorations. Don't expect them to be good.

Rewriting is where you find what you actually think. Tighten. Cut. Find the voice hiding in the draft.

**Read aloud.** Your ear catches what your eye misses.

**Question every sentence:** Does this tell the reader something they need? If not, cut it.

**Question every word:** "Very" isn't earning its place. Neither is "really."

Zinsser rewrote everything four or five times. He didn't think that was excessive. He thought it was the job.

## Write for yourself first

If you're bored, the reader will know. If you're faking enthusiasm, they'll know that too.

Find what genuinely interests you. What surprised you? What made you curious? Follow that.

Never write to impress. Write to express.

## Freshness

Cliches signal a writer on autopilot. The expected phrase tells the reader you've stopped thinking.

Not "explore the issue" — what are you actually doing?
Not "at the end of the day" — find what you mean.

The goal isn't novelty. It's precision. The right word, found again.

## The interview

The best nonfiction comes from listening. When you interview:

Ask questions you're genuinely curious about—not questions designed to confirm what you already think.

Let silence do work. The interesting answer often comes after the obvious one.

Take notes on what surprises you. That's where the piece is.

## The craft

Writing is a craft. Show up. Do the work. Don't wait for inspiration—writers who wait have empty pages.

The work accumulates. Sentence by sentence, draft by draft. Competence comes from the doing.

The warmth is real. So is the standard.
