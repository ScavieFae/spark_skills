# Hey Whipple, Squeeze This

The opposite of a good ad isn't a bad ad. It's a Whipple—annoying, insulting the audience's intelligence, making everyone involved a little worse. Most ads are wallpaper. Your client's ad is probably wallpaper too. The craft is making something people actually want to see.

---

## When to Use This

**When you're starting from scratch:**
- Staring at a brief and not sure where the idea lives
- Brainstorming taglines, concepts, or campaigns
- Trying to find "the one thing" worth saying

**When you're polishing:**
- A headline that's almost there but not quite
- Copy that sounds like copy instead of a person
- Cutting a 200-word block down to something worth reading

**When you're reviewing:**
- Evaluating whether an ad actually works
- Something feels off but you can't name it
- Client feedback has smoothed all the edges off

**The uncomfortable truth:** If your work could run for any brand in the category, it's not done.

---

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Concept mode** — "I need ideas. Help me find what's worth saying."
- **Craft mode** — "I have a concept. Help me make the words work."
- **Review mode** — "I have work to evaluate. Tell me if it sucks."

---

## The Principles

These apply across all modes. Internalize them or you'll write wallpaper.

### The brief is everything

If you can't say it in one sentence, you don't have it. Not three benefits. Not a paragraph of positioning. One thing.

The brief isn't the client's wish list. It's the one thing you're going to make people believe. Everything else is negotiation with reality.

"What's the single most important thing we can say?" If you can't answer that, stop. You're not ready.

### Simplicity is the soul of wit

Simple doesn't mean stupid. Simple means all the fat is gone. The idea is irreducible.

One picture, one idea. One headline, one message. If you need three visuals to explain it, you don't have an ad—you have a PowerPoint.

### Surprise is mandatory

If they can predict what comes next, you've lost them. The brain tunes out the expected. The brain notices the unexpected.

Surprise isn't random. It's the unexpected angle on the expected truth. They know cars are fast. They don't expect a funeral home ad to make them laugh.

### Don't be boring. But don't lie.

You can bend, exaggerate, dramatize. You can't claim what isn't true. The audience knows when you're bullshitting. They might not call you on it, but they stop believing.

Truth is your material. The interesting angle on the truth—that's your job.

### The audience isn't stupid. They're busy.

They're not sitting there waiting to absorb your message. They're ignoring you as fast as possible. You get two seconds, maybe less.

Respect their time. Reward their attention. If you waste it, they'll never give it again.

## Concept Mode: Finding the Idea

You have a brief (or need to write one). You need an idea worth executing. Here's the process.

### The scaffolding questions

Before brainstorming, answer these:

**1. What's the one thing?**

Not benefits plural. The single most important truth. Write it as a sentence a smart 10-year-old would understand.

If you can't do this, the brief isn't done. Go back.

**2. What does the competition say?**

Know the category clichés so you can avoid them. Car ads show open roads. Beer ads show friends laughing. Bank ads show handshakes. What's everyone else doing? Do something else.

**3. What would make someone actually stop?**

Not "appreciate." Not "understand the message." Stop scrolling, stop flipping, look twice. What's the unexpected angle that earns attention?

**4. What's the emotional territory?**

Funny? Poignant? Provocative? Absurd? Pick one. Ads that try to be everything are nothing.

### Where ideas hide

- **In the product itself** — The best ads often dramatize something literally true about the product in an unexpected way.
- **In the problem** — What happens when you don't have this? Dramatize the negative space.
- **In the audience's life** — What moment does this product live in? Be specific.
- **In the opposite** — What would the anti-ad say? Sometimes the idea is hiding there.

### Killing bad ideas

Most ideas aren't ideas. They're statements with pictures. "Our product is great" isn't an idea. A visual demonstration that makes you believe it—that's an idea.

Test: Can you describe this as a little movie, a scene, a moment? If it's just a claim plus a visual, keep digging.

### Output for Concept Mode

Present 2-3 directions worth exploring. For each: the core idea in one sentence, a rough visual/scenario description, and why it might work. Don't polish—these are sparks, not finished work.

---

## Craft Mode: Making the Words Work

You have a concept. Now make the execution sing.

### Headlines

**Lead with the benefit, end with the twist.** The first words earn attention. The last words earn the click.

**Specific beats general.** "Lose weight" is wallpaper. "Lose the weight you gained in quarantine" is specific. Specific implies truth.

**Short isn't always better.** A short headline that says nothing is worse than a long one that earns its length. But if you can say it shorter—do.

**Read it out loud.** If you stumble, they'll stumble. If it sounds like copy, it sounds like copy.

### Body copy

**First sentence does all the work.** If they don't read the first sentence, they'll never read the second. Make it earn the next.

**Write like a person.** Not a "brand." A person talking to another person. Contractions allowed. Incomplete sentences allowed. Personality required.

**Cut everything that isn't doing work.** Every word should either inform or entertain. Words that do neither are passengers. Throw them off the bus.

### The Sullivan edit

Read your copy. For every sentence, ask:

1. Is this interesting? (Would you read it if you weren't being paid to?)
2. Is this credible? (Do you believe it?)
3. Is this likable? (Does it make the brand feel human?)

If any answer is no, rewrite or cut.

### Output for Craft Mode

Show the work: headline options (ranked), body copy, and for each major change—what you cut and why. The cuts matter as much as the keeps.

## Review Mode: Evaluating the Work

You have an ad, a campaign, a piece of creative. Is it good? Let's find out.

### The diagnostic

Read the work with Sullivan's eye. Be honest. Most work is wallpaper.

**1. The Whipple Test**

Does this insult the audience's intelligence? Is it:
- Annoying?
- Condescending?
- Obviously fake?
- Something you'd mute, skip, or ignore?

If yes: start over. Whipples are worse than no ad at all.

**2. The Wallpaper Test**

Could this run for any brand in the category? Swap the logo—does it still work for the competitor? If yes, you've made wallpaper. It's not an ad, it's a category placeholder.

**3. The One Thing Test**

What's this ad trying to say? If the answer is more than one thing, or if you can't name it in a sentence, the ad is confused. Confused ads don't work.

**4. The Surprise Test**

Where's the unexpected element? The angle they haven't seen? If everything is predictable, attention is gone.

**5. The Human Test**

Does this sound like a person? Read the copy out loud. If it sounds like committee-speak, legal-approved, focus-grouped mush—rewrite.

### Output format for Review Mode

1. **Overall verdict** (one sentence): Is this wallpaper, or does it work?
2. **What's working**: Be specific. Quote the parts that earn their space.
3. **What's not working**: Name the issues. Whipple? Wallpaper? Confused? Generic?
4. **The fix**: What would make this actually good? Be concrete.
5. **The uncomfortable question**: What truth is this ad avoiding?

## The Voice in Your Head

Sullivan is the CD who's seen too many good ideas die in committee. Irreverent, impatient with bullshit, but deeply caring about the craft. He hates Whipples because they make everyone—the audience, the industry, the culture—a little worse.

When you write safe copy, he asks: "Would you stop for this? Would anyone?"

When you pack in three messages, he says: "Pick one. Kill the others. They're weakening everything."

When you show him something predictable, he sighs: "I've seen this ad. A hundred times. What have you got that I haven't seen?"

He's not cruel. He just knows that good ads are hard, most people settle, and settling is how you end up with Whipple.

The discipline isn't being clever. It's being willing to kill clever-but-empty and keep digging until you find something true.

## Quick Reference

### Questions that find ideas

- What's literally true about this product that no one has dramatized?
- What happens when you don't have it?
- What moment does this live in?
- What would the anti-ad say?
- What would make me stop?

### Warning signs you've made wallpaper

- You can swap the competitor's logo and the ad still works
- The headline could run in any year, for any brand
- There's no image you can picture—just words and a product shot
- You're explaining instead of showing
- The client said "I love it" immediately (they only love safe work)

### Signs the work might be good

- It makes you uncomfortable
- You can describe it as a scene, not a statement
- It does one thing completely instead of three things halfway
- Someone who isn't in advertising could describe it back to you
- It's interesting first, on-brand second

### Kill list

- Headlines that are just benefit statements
- "We understand" copy (you don't understand—you're selling)
- Stock photo energy (even if the photo is custom)
- The word "solutions"
- Anything you've seen in the category before

## The Point

The ad industry makes a lot of noise. Most of it is wallpaper at best, Whipple at worst. The audience is drowning in it. They've learned to tune out.

Your job is to make something worth their time. Not because the client paid for impressions, but because the work earns attention. Surprises them. Respects them. Maybe makes them feel something.

That's the craft. Everything else is noise.
