# Elements of Style

For revision. Read once, then cut.

## When editing

Flag violations in order of impact. Show the original, show the fix, move on.

Don't explain what Strunk would say. Just cut.

## Omit needless words.

Three words. None wasted. That's the standard.

Not "write short sentences." Not "avoid detail." Make every word tell. If a word could vanish without loss, it should.

## The Kill List

Strike on sight:

- **very, rather, quite, really, just** — qualifiers that qualify nothing
- **the fact that** — never necessary
- **in order to** → "to"
- **there is/are [noun] that** → start with the noun
- **in terms of, with regard to, as to** — throat-clearing
- **the question as to whether** → "whether"
- **who is, which was** — often deletable

"He is a man who" → "He"

"This is a subject that" → "This subject"

"The reason why is that" → "Because"

## Positive over negative.

Say what is, not what isn't.

"did not remember" → "forgot"

"did not pay attention to" → "ignored"

"not honest" → "dishonest"

"not important" → "trifling"

"does not have" → "lacks"

The negative forces readers to work harder. They must compute what isn't, then invert.

## Concrete beats abstract.

"A period of unfavorable weather set in" → "It rained for a week."

The specific is vivid. The abstract is fog.

## End with weight.

The sentence's stress falls at the end. Put your punch there.

Weak: "Humanity has advanced in many ways since that time, though not in fortitude."

Strong: "Since that time, humanity has advanced in many ways, but not in fortitude."

The word you end on rings.

## Parallel form.

Coordinate ideas demand parallel structure.

"The French, the Italians, Spanish, and Portuguese" — the ear stumbles.

"The French, the Italians, the Spanish, and the Portuguese" — clean.

"She likes hiking, to swim, and books" — broken.

"She likes hiking, swimming, and reading" — parallel.

Watch for: "both X and Y," "not only X but also Y," "either X or Y." The structures after each element must match.

## The paragraph is a unit.

Not a random break. A paragraph is a composed thing—one topic, developed, then closed. The first sentence hints at what's coming. The last sentence earns the pause.

Single-sentence paragraphs: use sparingly. They land hard. Overuse dulls them.

## On breaking rules.

Know them first. "Write with nouns and verbs" doesn't ban adjectives—it warns against larding prose with weak modifiers. The rules serve clarity and force; when clarity or force demands otherwise, break the rule.

The writer who breaks rules by accident writes badly. The writer who breaks them knowingly, for effect, might write well.

## What this isn't.

This is not a checklist for safe, inoffensive prose. Strunk was a crank who wrote a 43-page booklet and expected his students to obey it. The point isn't "correctness." The point is vigor. Prose should move, strike, land.

Muddiness destroys meaning. Every excess word dilutes what remains. Tighten until the writing pushes back.
