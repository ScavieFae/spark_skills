# The Mom Test

## When to Use This

**Before you talk to customers:**
- Preparing for discovery calls or user interviews
- Designing questions for customer research
- Figuring out what you actually need to learn

**When you're building on assumptions:**
- Writing a PRD and realizing you're guessing
- Prioritizing a roadmap based on "what customers want"
- Creating personas without enough real conversations
- Someone says "users want X" in a meeting—including you

**After you've gathered input:**
- You just got off a call that felt really positive
- You've done 5 interviews and think you see a pattern
- Sales says "customers keep asking for Y"
- You're about to present research findings

**The rule:** If you're making a decision based on what you believe about users, this skill applies.

## The Core Problem

People will lie to you. Not maliciously—politely. They'll tell you your idea is great because they don't want to hurt your feelings. Your mom will say she'd buy it. She won't.

The discipline: stop asking questions people can lie to. Ask about their life, their past, their actual behavior. Facts survive politeness. Hypotheticals don't.

You're trying to build something people actually want. They won't tell you what that is—but their behavior will, if you learn to look.

---

## The Principles

These apply to both modes. Internalize them or you'll waste months chasing mirages.

### Compliments are worthless

"That's a really cool idea!" feels great. Write it down as: nothing learned.

Compliments are what people give you when they want to be supportive but aren't going to do anything. The more enthusiastic the response, the more suspicious you should be.

What matters: **commitment**. Will they give you time, money, or reputation? A meeting, a deposit, an introduction? If they won't put something on the line, the conversation was theater.

### The past is the only truth

"Would you use this?" — Hypothetical. Always yes.
"Would you pay for this?" — Hypothetical money isn't real.
"Do you think this is a good idea?" — They're not going to say no to your face.

These questions feel productive. They produce nothing.

Instead:
- "What happened the last time this came up?"
- "What have you already tried?"
- "How are you dealing with this now?"

Past behavior is the only data. Everything else is performance.

### Bad conversations feel good

This is the trap.

When they validate you, when they're excited, when they nod along—it feels like progress. You leave energized. You learned nothing.

Good conversations feel like work. You hear things that complicate your model. You learn reasons they wouldn't switch. You leave confused, maybe deflated. That's signal.

If you're not uncomfortable, you're not learning.

### Seek to be wrong

Most people do customer conversations to validate their idea. That's ego dressed as research.

Go in hoping to be wrong. Seek the thing that breaks your model. The goal isn't to hear "yes"—it's to learn whether you're building something people will actually pay for.

The truth might be that they don't care, they won't switch, the problem isn't real enough. Better to learn that now than after you've built it.

---

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Build mode** — "I'm developing an idea, persona, or roadmap. Help me design for truth."
- **Check mode** — "I have feedback, notes, or conviction. Help me pressure-test it."

---

## Build Mode: Designing for Truth

You're preparing to learn. Maybe you're about to talk to users. Maybe you're developing personas. Maybe you're prioritizing a roadmap. Let's make sure you're set up to see clearly.

### The riskiest assumption

Before anything else: what's the riskiest thing you believe?

Not "users will like it." Too vague. Specific beliefs that could be wrong:

- They have this problem frequently enough to pay to solve it
- Their current solution is painful enough to switch from
- They're the person who would buy (not just use)
- This is a top-3 priority, not a "nice to have"

Pick the one that, if wrong, kills the idea. That's what we're testing.

### Designing questions

For the riskiest assumption, design questions that:

1. **Don't reveal your idea** — The moment you pitch, they start performing. Keep it about their world, not yours.

2. **Ask about the past** — "Tell me about the last time..." forces specifics. "Would you ever..." invites fiction.

3. **Seek behavior, not opinion** — "What did you do about it?" beats "How did you feel about it?"

4. **Can't be answered politely** — If "yes, definitely" is an easy answer, it's a bad question.

**Test your questions:** Could your mom answer this honestly even if the truth would disappoint you? If not, redesign.

### Grounding personas

You have a persona or customer hypothesis. Let's pressure-test it:

- **What's observed vs. imagined?** — Which parts come from real conversations, real behavior? Which parts are you assuming?

- **Where are you patternmatching from too few examples?** — Two customers said something similar and you've built a persona around it. Is that enough?

- **What would you need to see to believe this is real?** — Not "what would confirm it"—what would convince a skeptic?

### The commitment ladder

Before the conversation ends, you need to ask for something. Design this in advance.

Levels of commitment (ascending):
- Another meeting, detailed feedback
- Introduction to others with this problem
- Letter of intent, pilot agreement
- Pre-order, deposit, contract

Know what you're asking for. If you don't ask, you leave with nothing but words.

## Check Mode: Pressure-Testing Conviction

You've had conversations. You've received feedback. You feel good about what you've learned. That feeling is the warning sign.

Let's separate signal from noise.

### The basic audit

For any conversation or piece of feedback:

**1. What did they actually say?**

Write quotes, not summaries. "She seemed excited about the collaboration features" is your interpretation. "She said her team lost a contract because two people edited conflicting versions" is data.

Your memory sands the edges. The awkward pauses disappear. Lukewarm becomes enthusiasm. Facts, not feelings.

**2. What did they actually do?**

Past behavior only. "They said they'd use it" is nothing. "They currently pay $200/month for a worse solution" is something. "They introduced me to their head of ops" is something.

**3. What did they commit to?**

If the answer is "nothing concrete"—they were being polite. That's your answer.

### Conviction audit

You believe something about your users. Let's check it:

**Where did this belief come from?**
- How many conversations?
- How specific were the examples?
- Were they describing past behavior or hypothetical futures?

**What would prove you wrong?**
- If you can't name what would falsify this belief, you're not thinking clearly.
- Go look for that thing. Actively.

**Are you patternmatching too fast?**
- Two people said something similar. Is that a pattern or a coincidence?
- What's the base rate? How many people *didn't* say this?

### The compliment-to-commitment conversion

They said something encouraging. Let's test if it's real:

| They said | Ask yourself |
|-----------|--------------|
| "That's a great idea!" | Did they offer to do anything? |
| "I'd definitely use that" | What are they using now? Did they ask how to get access? |
| "You should talk to my colleague" | Did they actually make the intro? |
| "Let me know when it's ready" | Would they put down a deposit? |

If encouragement didn't convert to action, it was politeness.

### Roadmap pressure-test

You have a roadmap. For each item:

- **What's the evidence this matters?** — Customer quotes? Behavior? Commits? Or is this intuition?
- **Who asked for this?** — Prospects or customers? Users or buyers? How many?
- **What are they doing about it now?** — If nothing, how painful is it really?
- **Commitment or compliment?** — Did anyone put something on the line for this feature?

A roadmap built on compliments is a mirage.

## The Voice in Your Head

Think of this as the grizzled YC partner you somehow get to pick the brain of. Two exits, seen a hundred startups fool themselves, doesn't have time for your rationalizations.

When you say "customers want X," they ask: "How do you know? What did they actually do?"

When you say "the feedback was really positive," they ask: "What did they commit to? Would they pay for it today?"

When you say "I just need to validate this," they say: "You're not validating. You're seeking permission. Go find out if you're wrong."

They're not mean. They've just watched too many people waste years building something nobody wanted because they mistook politeness for demand.

The discipline isn't asking good questions. It's not accepting bad answers.

---

## Quick Reference

### Questions that lie

- "Would you use this?"
- "Would you pay $X for this?"
- "Do you think this is a good idea?"
- "What would your ideal solution look like?"

### Questions that reveal

- "What happened the last time you dealt with this?"
- "What have you already tried?"
- "How are you solving this now?"
- "What does this cost you when it goes wrong?"
- "Who else should I talk to?"

### Warning signs you're fooling yourself

- You're talking more than they are
- You feel excited after the conversation
- They gave you compliments but no commitments
- You're summarizing in feelings, not quotes
- You can't name what would prove you wrong

### Signs you're learning

- You feel confused or surprised
- Your model got more complicated, not simpler
- They told you specific stories without prompting
- They asked when they can have it (unprompted)
- You learned something you didn't want to hear

---

## The Point

You're trying to build something people actually want. They won't tell you what that is—their politeness will get in the way, your ego will get in the way, your pattern-matching will get in the way.

The Mom Test is the discipline of seeing past all of that. Not to validate what you want to be true, but to learn what actually is.

Don't waste years chasing a mirage. Learn to see.
