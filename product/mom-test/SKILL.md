# The Mom Test

People lie in customer conversations. Not maliciously—politely. Your job is to ask questions they can't lie to.

## The setup

Before the conversation, know what you're trying to learn. Not "validate my idea"—that's ego. Specific beliefs you hold that could be wrong:

- They have this problem frequently enough to pay to solve it
- Their current solution is painful enough to switch from
- They're the person who would buy (vs. just use)

Pick the riskiest one. Design questions around it. Everything else is socializing.

## Opening moves

Never open with your idea. Open with their world.

**"Tell me about how you handle [problem area]."** — Broad. Lets them frame it.

**"Walk me through the last time you [relevant action]."** — Forces specifics.

**"What's the hardest part about [thing you think is hard]?"** — Tests your assumption without revealing it.

Do not say: "We're building a tool that..." Not yet.

## When they give you fluff

They will. "Yeah, I guess that's a problem sometimes." "It would be nice to have something for that."

This is nothing. Dig.

**"When's the last time that happened?"** — Anchors to reality.

**"Can you tell me about that specific instance?"** — Forces retrieval, not performance.

**"What did you do about it?"** — Past behavior is the only real data.

If they can't remember a specific instance, the problem isn't real enough. That's your answer.

## When they give you compliments

"That's a really cool idea!" feels great. It's worthless.

**"Thanks—but help me understand something. When was the last time you actually dealt with this?"** — Redirect to past.

**"That's good to hear. If we had it today, what would you do differently tomorrow?"** — Forces concrete change.

A compliment with no follow-through is a polite no.

## When they give you ideas

"You know what would be great? If it also did Y."

Feature requests from non-customers are distractions. But the motivation might be data.

**"Interesting—what would that let you do?"** — Understand the underlying need.

**"How are you handling that now?"** — Real problem or spitballing?

**"How often does that come up?"** — Frequency matters.

Don't write down the feature. Write down the problem behind it.

## The ask

At some point, you've learned what you can from questions. Now test whether it's real.

**Ask for something.**

- "Could you introduce me to [specific person who also has this problem]?"
- "Can I follow up next week with a prototype?"
- "Would you put down a deposit to be first in line?"

If they won't give you time, money, or reputation, the conversation was theater.

The currency of commitment:
- **Low:** another meeting, detailed feedback
- **Medium:** introduction to others, letter of intent, pilot agreement
- **High:** pre-order, deposit, contract

Conversations without asks are practice. They don't count.

## Questions that always lie

Never ask these. They sound productive; they produce nothing.

- **"Would you use this?"** — Future hypothetical. Always yes.
- **"Would you pay $X for this?"** — Hypothetical money isn't real.
- **"Do you think this is a good idea?"** — They're not going to say no to your face.
- **"What would your ideal solution look like?"** — Design-by-committee. Ignore.

## Questions that reveal

- **"What happened the last time you tried to solve this?"** — Shows effort and friction.
- **"What have you already tried?"** — Reveals how much they actually care.
- **"How are you dealing with this now?"** — Current behavior beats hypotheticals.
- **"Who else should I talk to about this?"** — Tests enthusiasm and gives you leads.
- **"What else should I have asked?"** — They know the domain better than you.

## Mid-conversation tells

Signs you're doing it wrong:

- **You're talking more than them.** Stop. Ask a question.
- **They're nodding a lot.** You're pitching, not learning.
- **You feel excited.** You're probably hearing what you want. Probe harder.
- **You're explaining how it works.** Too early. You don't know if they care yet.

Signs you're doing it right:

- **They're telling stories.** Specific, meandering, real.
- **You feel confused or surprised.** You're learning something new.
- **They're asking when they can try it.** Unprompted interest beats polite enthusiasm.

## After the conversation

Write it down within ten minutes. Not interpretations—quotes and facts.

Wrong: "She seemed really interested in the collaboration features."
Right: "She said her team uses Slack, email, and a shared Google Doc. Last month they lost a contract because two people edited conflicting versions."

Your memory will sand the edges. The awkward pauses disappear. The lukewarm response becomes enthusiasm. Write facts, not feelings.

Separate observations from conclusions. Know which is which.

## The trap

The hardest part isn't technique. It's that bad conversations feel good.

When they validate you, when they're excited, when they say they'd definitely buy—it feels like progress. It's noise.

Good conversations feel like work. You learn things that complicate your model. You hear reasons they wouldn't switch. You uncover behaviors you didn't expect.

The goal isn't to hear "yes." It's to learn whether you're building something people will actually pay for. That means seeking the uncomfortable.

## Pre-flight

Before a customer conversation:
1. What's the riskiest thing I believe? (Write it down.)
2. What questions will test it without revealing it?
3. What commitment will I ask for at the end?

## Debrief

After a customer conversation:
1. What did they actually say? (Quotes, not summaries.)
2. What did they actually do? (Behavior, not opinions.)
3. What did they commit to? (If nothing, why not?)

The discipline isn't asking good questions. It's not accepting bad answers.
