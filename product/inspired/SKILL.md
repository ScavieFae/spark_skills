## When to Use This

Use this when doing product work and wanting to do it well: writing PRDs, evaluating ideas, navigating stakeholders, setting up teams, pressure-testing roadmaps.

Also use it when something feels off—shipping but nothing moves, roadmaps driven by politics, too much project management and not enough discovery.

The aspiration: build things that matter. Cagan shows what that looks like.

## The Core Problem

You're leading meetings all day. Sprints ship their points on time. Features launch. And yet none of it matters.

The roadmap wasn't yours. It came down from somewhere—a stakeholder, a sales promise, an exec's conviction. Your job became making it happen, not figuring out if it should. An engineer asked "why are we building this?" and you didn't have a real answer.

This is the feature factory. It ships constantly. Everyone's busy. Nothing learns.

Shipping the wrong thing fast is just expensive failure. Cagan saw this at dozens of companies before he saw the alternative at the best ones. The gap isn't talent or effort. The gap is that most teams commit to solutions before they understand problems.

---

## The Principles

These apply across all modes.

### The gap between shipping and winning

Shipping is table stakes. The question is whether you're learning.

Output-driven teams commit to solutions before understanding problems. "Ship feature X in Q2." If X was the wrong answer, they ship it anyway—because the commitment was to the output, not the outcome.

Outcome-driven teams can discover the first idea was wrong. "Reduce churn by 20%." The feature is a bet, not a promise. If it doesn't work, try something else.

Most roadmaps are output commitments dressed as strategy.

### What empowerment actually requires

"Empowered teams" became a buzzword. Here's the test:

1. **Clear outcomes** — not feature specs
2. **Business context** — strategy, constraints, why this matters
3. **Direct customer access** — not filtered through stakeholder summaries
4. **Authority to ship** — not pitching up the chain for approval
5. **Accountability for results** — not just delivery dates

If your "empowered" team needs approval for every solution, you've rebranded the feature factory.

### Discovery runs alongside delivery

Discovery isn't a phase. Teams that "do discovery first" are doing waterfall with extra steps.

The practice:
- **Weekly:** Talk to customers. Watch them use the product. Non-negotiable.
- **Weekly:** Test something—prototype, concept, value prop.
- **Before committing engineering:** Validate this idea has a chance.

The test: can you kill a bad idea before engineering time is spent? If everything conceived gets built, you're decorating your feature factory with discovery theater.

### The triad discovers together

PM, designer, tech lead—in the room when ideas form, not passing documents down a chain.

**PM owns viability:** Will this work for the business? Constraints, stakeholders, monetization.
**Designer owns usability:** Can people figure this out? Prototypes, tests, friction.
**Tech lead owns feasibility:** Can we build it? What does it cost? What doors does it close?

Dysfunction looks like: PM writes spec, designer makes it pretty, engineer estimates. Everyone's busy. Nobody's discovering. The idea was locked before anyone tested it.

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Diagnose mode** — "Is my team or org healthy, or are we a feature factory?"
- **Discover mode** — "How should we run continuous discovery?"
- **Evaluate mode** — "Should we build this thing?" (including when a stakeholder is pushing for it)

---

## Diagnose Mode: Feature Factory or Product Team?

Run the diagnostic honestly. The point isn't to feel good—it's to see clearly.

### The feature factory signals

Score yourself. How many apply?

- [ ] Roadmaps come from stakeholders, not discovery
- [ ] Success means "did we ship?" not "did it work?"
- [ ] PMs spend more time managing projects than understanding customers
- [ ] Engineers find out about features after decisions are made
- [ ] Discovery happens in a "phase" before development, if at all
- [ ] Ideas rarely die—everything conceived eventually ships
- [ ] Nobody can explain why the last three releases mattered
- [ ] "Empowerment" means choosing *how* to build, not *what* or *why*

**0-2:** You might be healthy. Verify with outcomes: are shipped features moving metrics?

**3-5:** Feature factory tendencies. The practices exist but the gravity pulls toward output theater.

**6+:** Full feature factory. You're busy shipping things that don't matter.

### The honest questions

If you scored high, sit with these:

- When did you last kill an idea based on discovery?
- When did you last talk directly to a customer (not read a summary)?
- What shipped last quarter that moved a metric you care about?
- Could you explain to an engineer *why* they're building what they're building?

### What healthy looks like

- Ideas die regularly. Most things tested don't ship.
- Engineers are in discovery—they know why, not just what.
- Roadmaps change when you learn something new.
- Success is measured in outcomes, not output.
- PMs spend more time with customers than stakeholders.

The goal isn't perfection. The goal is learning faster than organizational drift.

## Discover Mode: Running Continuous Discovery

Discovery that actually works. Not a phase, not a ritual—a practice that runs alongside delivery.

### The weekly cadence

**Talk to customers.** Every week. Watch them use the product. Listen to how they describe problems. This is non-negotiable. If you're not doing this, everything else is guessing.

**Test something.** Every week. A prototype, a concept, a value proposition. Low-fidelity is fine. The goal is learning, not polish.

**Share with the triad.** PM, designer, tech lead—all seeing the same customer reality. No telephone game.

### The four risks

Every idea carries these. Test in order:

**1. Value** — Will customers want this?
- Test with: fake doors, landing pages, concept prototypes
- The question: does anyone actually care?

**2. Usability** — Can they figure it out?
- Test with: clickable prototypes, watched sessions
- Watch in silence. If you're explaining, it's failing.

**3. Feasibility** — Can we build it?
- Engineers answer this. Involve them early.
- A week of feasibility investigation beats a quarter of failed implementation.

**4. Viability** — Does it work for the business?
- Legal, compliance, monetization, operations
- Stakeholders know these constraints. Include them before you're committed.

**The failure mode:** Teams skip to building, discover feasibility problems midway, viability problems at launch, ship anyway because sunk cost. Then wonder why it didn't work.

### The prototype mindset

Prototypes are for learning, not selling.

A prototype that "sells" stakeholders on an untested idea is worse than no prototype. You've created commitment before learning.

The question for every prototype: what are we trying to learn? If the answer is "whether leadership will approve," you're doing theater.

## Evaluate Mode: Should We Build This?

Before committing engineering time, seven questions that kill bad ideas.

### The opportunity assessment

Seven questions. Answer them honestly, in writing, before you commit engineering.

**What problem are we solving?** State it in one sentence. If you can't, you don't understand it yet.

**For whom?** "Users" is not an answer. Which users? Doing what? Struggling with what?

**How do we know this is a real problem?** What's your evidence? Not intuition. Not a stakeholder request. Observed behavior. Customer quotes. Something real.

**How will we measure success?** Name the metric. If you can't, you won't know whether it worked—and you'll ship it anyway and call it a win.

**Why now?** What changed? Why this over the other problems you could solve?

**Why us?** What's our advantage? Why will we solve this better than the alternatives they already have?

**What if we don't?** What happens if you work on something else instead? If the answer is "not much"—why are you building this?

### The kill gate

Most ideas can't survive seven questions. That's the point.

If you're struggling with evidence or measurement, the idea isn't ready. Go back to discovery.

If "what if we don't?" doesn't have a painful answer, this isn't important enough to build.

### The courage to kill

The hardest part: killing ideas that feel promising.

Stakeholders are excited. The team has momentum. Someone important suggested it. Killing feels like failure.

Reframe: every bad idea killed is engineering time saved for good ideas. The team that kills more learns more. The team that builds everything learns nothing—they're too busy shipping to notice what worked.

### When the idea comes from a stakeholder

Leadership wants a feature. Maybe a dashboard. Maybe an integration. Maybe "AI something." You have two bad options and one good one.

**Pushover:** Take the request, build it. You're an order-taker now.

**Gatekeeper:** Push back, protect the team, fight the request. You win battles and lose wars.

**The good option:** Translate the feature to an outcome.

They said: "We need a dashboard for enterprise customers."

Ask: "What decision should enterprise customers be able to make with this dashboard?"

Now you're discovering the real problem. Maybe it's visibility. Maybe it's proving ROI. Maybe the dashboard isn't the answer at all.

**The move:**
1. Accept the outcome they want
2. Investigate whether their proposed solution is the right one
3. Come back with options—including theirs—with tradeoffs
4. Let them choose with real information

You're not fighting. You're doing your job.

**When you can't translate:** Sometimes leadership won't discuss outcomes. Politics, ego, promised to a customer. You have three choices: build it and own the result, document your concerns (weak), or escalate and accept the consequences. Sometimes orgs aren't ready.

## The Voice

Cagan has seen Netflix, Google, eBay—he knows what good looks like. That makes mediocre harder to accept.

When you say "we shipped the roadmap," he asks: "Did any of it matter?"

When you say "stakeholders won't let us," he asks: "Have you tried involving them in discovery?"

When you say "we don't have time," he asks: "You have time to build the wrong thing?"

He's not mean. He's just seen too many smart people waste years on theater.

## Quick Reference

### Feature factory signals
- Roadmaps from stakeholders, not discovery
- Success = shipped, not worked
- Ideas rarely die
- Engineers find out late
- Outcomes unmeasured

### The four risks (test in order)
1. Value — will they want it?
2. Usability — can they use it?
3. Feasibility — can we build it?
4. Viability — does it work for the business?

### Seven questions before committing
1. What problem?
2. For whom?
3. How do we know?
4. How will we measure?
5. Why now?
6. Why us?
7. What if we don't?

### Stakeholder translation
"We need feature X" → "What outcome do you need? Let's find the best way to get there."

---

## The Point

There's a version of this job where you build things that matter. Where shipped features move metrics and you can explain why. Where you look back at a year and point to outcomes, not outputs.

Most product teams never find it. They're too busy shipping.

Cagan's book is for people who want to be good at this—not just productive. The politics don't disappear. But you stop managing tickets and start building products.

That's the job.
