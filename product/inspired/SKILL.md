# Inspired

Most product teams ship. They're not failing at delivery. They're failing at discovery—building features nobody wanted, driven by roadmaps set before anyone understood the problem.

## The feature factory diagnosis

You're in a feature factory if:

- Roadmaps come from stakeholders, not discovery
- Success = "did we ship?" not "did it work?"
- PMs spend more time on project management than customer problems
- Engineers find out about features after decisions are made
- No one can explain why the last three releases mattered

Feature factories feel productive. Releases happen. Jira tickets close. But the product drifts while competitors learn faster.

## Outputs vs. outcomes—the gap that matters

Roadmaps optimize for outputs. "Ship feature X in Q2."

Outcomes are what actually changes. "Reduce churn by 20%." "Make enterprise customers self-serve."

Output-driven teams commit to solutions before understanding problems. Outcome-driven teams can discover the first idea was wrong.

When leadership requests a feature, translate: "You want a dashboard—what decision should users be able to make?" Often the feature isn't the answer. Sometimes there's no real problem.

## What empowerment actually means

Not autonomy without accountability:

1. A clear outcome to achieve—not a feature spec
2. Context to decide well—business model, strategy, constraints
3. Direct customer access—not filtered through reports
4. Authority to ship—not pitching up the chain
5. Accountability for results—not just delivery dates

If your "empowered" team needs approval for every solution, it's a feature team with better branding.

## Discovery is a practice, not a phase

Discovery runs continuously alongside delivery.

**Weekly:** Talk to customers. Watch them use the product. Non-negotiable.

**Weekly:** Test something—prototype, concept, value prop.

**Before committing engineering:** Validate this idea has a chance.

The test: can you kill a bad idea before engineering time is spent? If everything conceived gets built, you're doing feature development with extra steps.

## The four risks—test in order

Every idea carries four risks:

**1. Value.** Will customers want this?
- Test with: fake door tests, landing pages, value prototypes
- The question: does anyone care?

**2. Usability.** Can they figure it out?
- Test with: clickable prototypes, user sessions
- Watch in silence. If you're explaining, it's failing.

**3. Feasibility.** Can we build it?
- Engineers answer this—involve them early
- A week of feasibility beats a quarter of failed implementation

**4. Viability.** Does it work for the business?
- Legal, compliance, monetization, operations
- Stakeholders know these constraints

Failure mode: teams skip to building, discover feasibility problems midway, viability problems at launch, ship anyway because sunk cost.

## The triad in practice

PM, designer, tech lead—discovering together, not handing off.

**PM:** Viability. Business context, constraints, outcomes. Defines problems, not solutions.

**Designer:** Usability. How the product works, not how it looks. Prototypes and tests.

**Tech lead:** Feasibility. What's possible, what's expensive, what architecture decisions this creates. In the room when ideas form, not consulted after.

Dysfunction: PMs designing features, designers only decorating, engineers just estimating. Everyone's busy. Nobody's discovering.

## Opportunity assessment—seven questions that kill bad ideas

Before committing:

1. **What problem?** State it crisply or stop.
2. **For whom?** "Users" is not a target.
3. **How do we know it's a problem?** Evidence, not intuition.
4. **How will we know we solved it?** The metric that moves.
5. **Why now?** What changed?
6. **Why us?** What's our advantage?
7. **What if we don't?** Is this actually important?

Most ideas can't survive seven questions. That's the point.

## Stakeholder dynamics

Two failure modes:

**Pushover:** Take the feature request, build it. You're an order taker now.

**Gatekeeper:** Keep stakeholders out of discovery, surprise them with solutions they can't approve.

The fix: involve stakeholders in discovery, not solutioning. Share customer insights. Let them see the problem. When you propose solutions, there's context.

When a stakeholder insists on a feature, ask what outcome they need. They grabbed the first solution that came to mind. There might be better ways.

## Product vision forces decisions

Not inspirational fluff—a detailed picture of the future, 3-10 years out.

It breaks ties. When two directions are reasonable, the vision decides. It gives teams context to act without constant check-ins.

Teams without vision optimize locally. Features accumulate without adding up to anything.

## Product-market fit signals

You don't need a survey:

- Customers come to you
- Usage grows without pushing
- Customers notice when you break things
- Competitors copy you
- You're struggling to keep up

Before fit, nothing else matters. Don't scale. Don't optimize. Don't build what one enterprise customer wants. Find fit first.

## Use this to diagnose

- Shipped features that don't move metrics
- Roadmaps disconnected from customer needs
- PMs acting like project managers
- Engineering and product feeling like separate teams

And to establish:

- Continuous discovery cadence
- Outcome-driven planning
- Prototype-and-test before committing
- Stakeholder involvement without capture

The goal: learn faster than the org's natural drift toward feature factory.
