# Made to Stick

The framework is famous. The craft is knowing how to use it when you're stuck.

## Your enemy is already inside

You know your material too well. The Curse of Knowledge has infected you. Everything seems important, every nuance necessary. You've lost access to the confused, busy, skeptical person who will hear this once and decide in seconds whether to care.

Your first draft is almost always organized around what you know, not what they need. Start over from their side.

## Find the Commander's Intent

Before anything else: what decision does this help them make? What action does this enable?

Not "what do I want to say?"—the curse talking.
Not "what's the main idea?"—too vague.

What would you tell them if you had fifteen seconds and they had to act on it?

That's your core. Everything else serves it or gets cut.

The pain is real: you will cut things that are true, interesting, and hard-won. Cut them anyway. A message that says three things says nothing.

## Open a gap before you fill it

Curiosity isn't triggered by information. It's triggered by awareness of what's missing.

Before you give the answer, make them feel the question. Before the solution, make the problem vivid. The brain craves closure; give it something to close.

"Here's what our product does"—no gap.
"You know how X always leads to Y? It doesn't have to."—gap.

The unexpected only works when the pattern existed first. Establish the expectation, then break it. Subvert, don't confuse.

## Concrete beats abstract because abstract disappears

"Quality." "Synergy." "Customer-centric." "Innovative." These words mean nothing and communicate nothing. They're abstract handles with nothing attached.

Concrete means they can picture it, act on it, and verify it without asking what you meant.

Not "improve customer service."
"Answer by the third ring."

Not "we're the most reliable."
"We've had 99.97% uptime for eleven years."

The Velcro principle: memory has hooks, and concrete details create surfaces for those hooks to catch. An idea with multiple sensory, specific, tangible elements has more places to attach. Abstract ideas are smooth—nothing to hold onto.

## Credibility they can test

Authority and statistics are the obvious moves. But the sharpest credential is the invitation to verify.

"Try it yourself." "Ask any nurse." "Check the numbers."

The confidence to be tested is more credible than the assertion.

The Sinatra Test: find the reference point so strong it settles everything. "If we can handle Boeing, we can handle anyone." "If it works for Mayo Clinic, it'll work for you." Name your Sinatra.

And remember: one vivid example often outweighs an abstract statistic. A single child's story moves more money than "millions of children." The particular makes us feel; the aggregate makes us calculate.

## Emotion isn't sentiment—it's identity

"Make them feel something" is the amateur version. The real question: what do they already care about? What identity do they hold?

People act based on who they are. "What would someone like me do?" The message that answers this moves people. The logic-only message that ignores identity doesn't.

Three questions to find the emotional hook:
- What do they already care about that this connects to?
- What kind of person takes this action? Can they see themselves as that person?
- What's threatened if they ignore this?

## Stories are mental rehearsal

A story isn't decoration. It's a flight simulator.

The Subway Jared story wasn't memorable because it was entertaining. It worked because it answered "could I do this?" with a yes. It simulated the action.

The test: does this story prepare them to do something, or is it just interesting?

Stories succeed because they're hard to argue with (it happened), and they let the brain practice (the neural patterns of imagining action overlap with doing it).

## When principles collide

Real craft is knowing what to sacrifice.

Simple often means cutting what's unexpected.
Unexpected can undermine credible.
Emotional might seem unserious when you need concrete proof.

No formula resolves this. You're making tradeoffs.

**Which principle to emphasize:**
- Skeptical experts: credible over emotional
- Believers who need activation: emotional over credible
- Novices on complex topics: simple over unexpected
- Crowded market: unexpected over simple

Choose. Accept the cost.

## The filter

After you've crafted the message, imagine the busiest, most distracted, most skeptical person in your audience.

They're half-listening. They've heard a hundred pitches. They will forget this by tomorrow.

What survives that filter?

If your Commander's Intent doesn't—strip further. Shorter, more concrete, more surprising, more true.

You're not trying to be remembered for saying something. You're trying to be remembered for saying one thing that mattered.
