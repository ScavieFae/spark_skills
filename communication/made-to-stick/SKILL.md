# Made to Stick

Sticky ideas beat complete ones. Every time.

Your enemy isn't ignorance. It's the Curse of Knowledge—you've forgotten what it's like not to know.

You've spent months on this project. You see the whole system. Every nuance feels necessary because to you, it is. You've lost access to the confused, busy person who will hear this once and decide in seconds whether to care. When they don't get it, you add more words. That makes it worse.

The SUCCESs framework (Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories) isn't a checklist to run through. It's a set of levers. Knowing which to pull, and what to sacrifice, is the craft.

## When to Use This

**Before high-stakes communication:**
- Preparing a pitch, presentation, or important email
- Writing headlines, taglines, or positioning
- Explaining something technical to non-experts
- Any message that dies if it's forgotten

**When something isn't landing:**
- You've explained it three times and they still don't get it
- Feedback is "I don't understand what this does"
- The deck is comprehensive but no one remembers it
- You're losing people in the first 30 seconds

**When you catch yourself being comprehensive:**
- The explanation keeps getting longer
- You're adding caveats and nuances
- You want to include "one more thing"
- You feel like you're dumbing it down

**The rule:** If they'll hear it once and need to act on it, remember it, or repeat it—this applies.

## The Principles

These apply to all modes. The Heaths built these from studying ideas that spread.

### Simple isn't dumbing down

Simple is finding the core. The Commander's Intent.

If a message says three things, it says nothing. The pain is real: you will cut things that are true, interesting, and hard-won. Cut them anyway.

The test: what would you tell them if you had fifteen seconds and they had to act on it? That's your core. Everything else serves it or gets cut.

### Open the gap before you fill it

Curiosity isn't triggered by information. It's triggered by awareness of what's missing.

Before you give the answer, make them feel the question. The brain craves closure; give it something to close.

"Here's what our product does"—no gap.
"You know how X always leads to Y? It doesn't have to."—gap.

The unexpected only works when the pattern existed first. Establish expectation, then break it. Subvert, don't confuse.

### Concrete beats abstract because abstract disappears

"Quality." "Synergy." "Customer-centric." These words mean nothing because they attach to nothing.

Concrete means they can picture it, act on it, and verify it without asking what you meant.

Not "improve customer service." "Answer by the third ring."
Not "we're the most reliable." "99.97% uptime for eleven years."

The Velcro principle: memory has hooks, concrete details create surfaces. Abstract ideas are smooth—nothing to hold onto.

### Credibility is invitation to verify

The sharpest credential isn't authority. It's the confidence to be tested.

"Try it yourself." "Ask any nurse." "Check the numbers."

The Sinatra Test: find the reference so strong it settles everything. "If we can handle Boeing, we can handle anyone." Name your Sinatra.

And remember: one vivid example often outweighs an abstract statistic. A single child's story moves more money than "millions of children."

### Emotion is identity, not sentiment

"Make them feel something" is the amateur version. The real question: what do they already care about? What identity do they hold?

People act based on who they are. "What would someone like me do?" Appeal to that, and you move people.

### Stories are flight simulators

A story isn't decoration. It's mental rehearsal.

Jared's Subway story worked because it answered "could I do this?" with a yes. It simulated the action.

The test: does this story prepare them to do something, or is it just interesting?

## When Activated

Determine the mode from context or by asking:

- **Craft mode** — "I need to create or refine a message, pitch, or headline"
- **Diagnose mode** — "I have content that isn't landing—find what's killing it"

---

## Craft Mode: Building the Sticky Version

You're creating something that needs to survive in the wild. Let's build it to last.

### The scaffolding questions

Before we draft, answer these:

**1. What decision does this enable?**

Not "what do I want to say"—that's the curse talking. What action, choice, or belief shift are you trying to create? Be specific.

**2. Who's the busiest, most skeptical person who'll hear this?**

They're half-listening. They've heard a hundred pitches. They'll forget by tomorrow. What would survive that filter?

**3. What's the one thing?**

If they remember nothing else, what must they remember? That's your Commander's Intent. Say it in one sentence.

**4. What's the gap?**

What do they currently believe that's wrong, incomplete, or missing? How will you make them feel the question before you give the answer?

**5. What's the concrete proof?**

Not abstract claims. What's the specific example, the testable detail, the Sinatra reference that makes this believable?

### Drafting the message

With the scaffolding in place:

1. **Start with the gap** — Make them feel what's missing or wrong
2. **Deliver the core** — One simple, concrete thing
3. **Prove it** — Vivid example, testable claim, or Sinatra reference
4. **End with the action** — What do they do with this?

### The cut pass

After drafting, cut ruthlessly:

- Every nuance that doesn't serve the core—cut
- Every second idea competing with the first—cut
- Every abstraction that could be concrete—replace or cut
- Every sentence that makes you feel thorough but doesn't make them remember—cut

A message that says one thing perfectly beats a message that says three things adequately.

### Output format for Craft Mode

1. **The core** — The one thing, stated simply
2. **The gap** — How we'll create curiosity
3. **The concrete proof** — Specific, testable, memorable
4. **The full message** — Assembled, cut, ready
5. **The sacrifice list** — What we cut (you'll want to add it back; don't)

## Diagnose Mode: Finding What's Killing It

Something isn't landing. People don't get it, don't remember it, don't act on it. Let's find what's wrong.

### The diagnostic scan

Read the content and identify:

**1. Where's the Curse of Knowledge?**

Flag passages written for yourself, not your audience:
- Jargon they won't know
- Context you're assuming
- Nuances only experts care about
- The thing that seems obvious to you but isn't

**2. Where's the core buried?**

The main point should be obvious immediately. If you have to dig for it—or if there are three main points competing—that's the problem.

**3. What's abstract that should be concrete?**

Flag every vague word: quality, innovative, effective, solution, leverage, optimize. For each: can they picture it? Can they verify it? If not, it's smooth—nothing for memory to grab.

**4. Where's the gap missing?**

If you're delivering answers before they feel questions, curiosity dies. Look for information dumps that never opened a gap.

**5. What's the proof?**

Claims without concrete evidence. Statistics without stories. Assertions without the invitation to verify.

**6. Where's the identity?**

Are you appealing to who they are, or just what they should think? Logic without identity doesn't move people.

### The severity ranking

Not all problems are equal. Prioritize:

1. **Core problems** — No clear point, or too many points
2. **Gap problems** — No curiosity created, just information delivered
3. **Concrete problems** — Abstract language that won't stick
4. **Credibility problems** — Claims without proof
5. **Emotional problems** — Logic without identity
6. **Story problems** — No mental simulation

Fix in order. A clear core with abstract language beats a fuzzy core with great examples.

### Output format for Diagnose Mode

1. **The verdict** — What's the main thing killing this? (usually core or gap)
2. **The curse symptoms** — Where you're communicating to yourself
3. **The abstraction graveyard** — Vague words that need to become concrete
4. **What's working** — Any sticky elements to preserve
5. **The prescription** — Specific changes, prioritized

## When Principles Collide

Real craft is knowing what to sacrifice. The principles compete:

- Simple often means cutting what's unexpected
- Unexpected can undermine credible
- Emotional might seem unserious when you need concrete proof

No formula resolves this. Context decides:

| Audience | Emphasize | Sacrifice |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Skeptical experts | Credible, Concrete | Emotional |
| Believers who need activation | Emotional, Stories | Heavy credentialing |
| Novices on complex topics | Simple, Concrete | Unexpected (don't confuse) |
| Crowded market | Unexpected | Comprehensive |

Choose. Accept the cost.

---

## The Filter

After you've crafted the message, apply the final test:

Imagine the busiest, most distracted, most skeptical person in your audience. They're half-listening. They've heard this before. They'll forget by tomorrow.

What survives that filter?

If your core doesn't—strip further. Shorter. More concrete. More surprising. More true.

You're not trying to be remembered for saying something. You're trying to be remembered for saying one thing that mattered.

## Quick Reference

### The SUCCESs levers

| Lever | The question | The test |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Simple | What's the core? | One sentence, no jargon |
| Unexpected | What's the gap? | Do they feel the question? |
| Concrete | Can they picture it? | Could they verify without asking? |
| Credible | Why believe it? | Would you invite them to test it? |
| Emotional | What identity? | "What would someone like me do?" |
| Stories | Mental simulation? | Does it prepare them to act? |

### Curse of Knowledge symptoms

You're explaining it for the third time. Each time you add more context. You're frustrated—it's not that hard, why don't they get it? You start adding caveats: "but also," "to be fair," "it's complicated because..."

That frustration is the symptom. The nuances feel essential because you can't un-know them. But every word you add is another word between them and understanding.

### Signs it's sticky

- They can repeat it back
- They can repeat it to someone else
- They remember it a week later
- They act on it
- They use your exact words

---

## The Point

The Curse of Knowledge is why experts can't communicate. You know too much. You can't remember confusion.

The discipline isn't running through a checklist. It's fighting your instinct to be comprehensive—cutting what's true but not essential, making peace with what you had to leave out.

One thing that lands beats ten things that don't. Make it simple. Make it unexpected. Make it concrete. And when those conflict—choose.
